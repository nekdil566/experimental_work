Manuel Quilichini,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is a ripoff. And shame on Amazon for not allowing a refund,"Don't buy this product. I purchased it for my Amazon Kindle Fire which i recently acquired. I saw the reviews and was impressed but I failed to see the dates of the review. I downloaded the product and it does not work on my Kindle Fire (nowhere did it say it was incompatible). I have reached out to the vendor but guess what? It does not exist anymore.To add insult to injury, I have tried to seek a refund from Amazon but its automated system will not allow it. So it seems I have been taken for a ride by the unscrupulous and now non-existent vendor and by Amazon who is still selling a product without any support whatsoever or response from the vendor. Shame on Amazon!!!!",,,,negative

ABuyer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do you update to 4.6.4, it's broken!","It used to be good, but the latest update 4.6.4 is completely broken. It deson't open PDF on Android 6 (Marshmallow) or 7 (Nogat). Who knows what system the developer has tested on before the release. Mobeera, please update the fix ASAP before everyone switches to other apps!",,,,negative
Robert,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible terrible,"I tried my best to give a benefit of a doubt. But at the end I gave up. I was studying a pdf file, high lighting, underlining, commenting, making notes etc. to my surprise it started to crash on the 9, out of the 10 pages document. Before this happened the text I wrote on it kept on freezing I had to wait for the tablet to respond after 40 second or so. The worst part is that if you want to open this document using Adobe reader the only thing that is saved are the high lights and the comments. I cleaned the tablet (galaxy tab 3 8 note) from the junk, the memory and killed background tasks, I uninstalled/installed but that didn't help either Arrrghh! to think that I spent 2 hours in this so important document only to re-studying again.",,,,negative

JG,1.0 out of 5 stars,No Longer Works :(,"Like others, I began receiving the ""invalid file!"" message when attempting to open any pdf file with PDF Max Pro after upgrading to Marshmallow.

eyeloot,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best Android PDF reader I have found,After struggling with several Android PDF viewer apps I have finally found one that loads quickly and easily scrolls through documents. I guess I was lucky when I used iOS to find something. It seemed even highly rated apps had problems opening and scrolling through simple documents. This one has no problems opening any document I throw at it. Thanks Mobeera.,,,,negative
Yara,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great but it crashes often,"I love the app. However, it does crash on me many times. If you do not save as you edit your pdf files, you can lose your work. I would give it 5 stars if it didn't crash on me most of the time. I still use it because most of my professors post their notes online as pdf files. I find it easier to write notes on my tablet without having to carry many sheets of paper around.",,,,negative
KT,2.0 out of 5 stars,not good,"I was excited to try this app, but unfortunately, I discovered that the save button is not working.

Daniel,4.0 out of 5 stars,A very good PDF reader and writer,"This is the third PDF reader I have and the one I can read texts the easiest.

I made the mistake of paying for this app and it doesn't even work for what I need it for.Â  So don't waste your money.Â  Just go download Adobe Reader from the Amazon Appstore and it does what you need it to do (plus its FREE).",,,,negative

Lucas Torres,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stop Giving Bad Ratings,"For all those that are saying this doesn't work, are incorrect.As you can clearly see by the screenshots, this works perfectly well,you people are just doing it wrong, and some devices are really useless, im on a kindle fire,(NOT HD!) And everything works just fine, when i went to download this on my kindle fire HD, nothing worked, so basically, the HD is just glitching out and is breaking the app,and for those who are saying the ipad version has more features, at the time this was posted there was only 32 ratings. Which means this app was released recently. SO THEY HAVENT HAD TIME TO FULLY IMPLEMENT ALL THE FEATURES. So stop giving this bad reviews because it wont work, or the highlighting is glitched and other stuff ive seen, give these people a chance, for all we know, they might be working on 12 other apps!Bottom line:Give them time to fully implement all the features, and tell amazon to make a better Kindle Fire HD! Because the Kindle HD has numerous complaints about, blue tint on edges of screen, yellow tint to the screen, wifi not working, just go on the page and read all the one star reviews!

Toya Hayden,1.0 out of 5 stars,App Does Not Perform as Stated,"I downloaded this app for my MacBook Pro on 10/13/13.Â  It has failed to work on my MacBook.Â  I have tweeted my issue.Â  In addition, I have emailed support.Â  I sent an email with the PDF files that I was trying to open.Â  I also included a video showing the app is not working properly.Â  It has been 3 days.Â  This is beyond frustrating that I cannot get the proper support to resolve the issue.Â  I contacted AppleCare, and they stated everything is working properly on my Mac.Â  I cannot believe that I cannot receive assistance with an app that I purchased.Â  This is ridiculous.Â  I purchased and downloaded another app that is very similar to this one and it works perfectly.Â  More importantly, I have left a review of this application giving it another terrible rating.Â  The likelihood of this app succeeding after my App Store review, tweets, and Facebook comments posts is very slim.Â  Clearly, customer reviews are very important to consumers.Â  I am beyond disappointed in how the support department has ignored my issue.Â  Furthermore, I have requested a refund for this app.Â  This is the worst experience that I have had with an application.Â  I have hundreds of applications on my Mac, iPad, and iPhone and all of them function as stated except for the one from your company.Â  Each time this app crashes a crash report is sent to Apple.Â  Does your company receive a copy of this report?Â  I am going to guess that you do receive a copy of this report.Â  Apple is a very innovative company in the number 1 brand in the world.Â  I can't imagine why you haven't reviewed the crash report.Â  However,Â  I was advised by AppleCare that I can callback with my case number and they will begin a process to investigate my complaint in detail.Â  I will be contacting them today!Thank you,Toya Hayden",,,,negative

Timothy Thomas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I was looking for,"I hate not being able to print my downloaded documents directly from my Kindle. All I saw on Print Hammermill was lines and lines of numbers and letters, and had to write down the numbers from my documents, because I couldn't remember all that. Then go and searched through all that code for the correct document number. Before, I just went to My Documents on Kindle, selected the one I wanted, selected Print, and boom - done. What was wrong with keeping that, PLUS the app. if that's what someone wanted? Everything gets more and more complicated and more difficult to use. Who sits around all day and thinks of ways to make things more complicated? As an added insult to the public, there are never any instructions available anymore. Not everyone is a techie.

William R. Yount,1.0 out of 5 stars,Takes over your computer without permission,"I bought this so I could edit MS Office docs on my Fire Tablet. Then I decided to add a copy on my desktop. I was so impressed with the interface, I went ahead an bought the license for both (though the programs still treat me as a ""trial"" user, and I have not received any activation codes.But the worst discovery is that OfficeSuite makes itself the default program for all MS Office products automatically during installation. When I download an MSOffice doc from the web, it automatically opens in OfficeSuite. In order to open it in Word, I have to ""save document."" I cannot click on the document immediately, or OfficeSuite will load it. I must then go to File Explorer, open the Download folder, right click on the document, and manually CHOOSE Word. I have been unable to find any workaround.I am more than frustrated. I am angry, and I've paid money for the ""Premium"" version that has strong-armed itself to the front. Perhaps OfficeSuite is the ONLY option for FIRE users to edit MSOffice docs. But now I have ruined my desktop computer. Buyer beware.

Mr Wizard,1.0 out of 5 stars,BOY DO I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS SOFTWARE,"CAPITALIZATION in this review is NOT screaming ... just highlighting ...My initial ""review to myself"" was positive, when I tested a plain, short ""Word"" style document. It seemed to work just fine, and NOBODY releases software that doesn't work do they? snort!!! So I bought the program, and BOY! am I SORRY! that I did so, because I can now no longer get a refund as I have struggled SO long and SO hard, trying to make this piece of software do the simplest tasks.There is SO much of this app that either just plain does not work, or has VERY limited functionality, or does not work quite right, that I CANNOT in good conscience recommend this app to ANYONE for ANY reason.I have written to Support twice, and beyond the ""We have received your request..."" email notice, I have received NO response whatsoever to my request for assistance or clarification.The so called HELP system is more a list of what the menu options are than they are instructions on how to use this app. As a help system, it is WOEFULLY, and PITIFULLY inadequate. So mix the fact that parts of it, despite being available to the user, just do not work, the lack of reliable support and the lack of a comprehensive help system, and you get a miserable, FAILED attempt at a piece of software that should not have gone to market for a SIGNIFICANT additional period of time for development.And when I bought this, my ONLY option was a subscription so that I have to pay for it again, and AGAIN, EVERY year. What the heck happened to just being able to BUY a piece of software?These people need a couple of million bucks of investment money so that they can do some more development on this software so that it WORKS, and works COMPLETELY before they start selling it. As it stands, it needs a LOT more development. While SOME small parts of it DO work, it is NOT a replacement for microsoft office. There is just too much of it that does not work to warrant buying this app.I just CANNOT imagine a greater waste of money. This is probably THE worst purhase that I have EVER made online.",,,,negative
Krystal Bella,5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost Perfect for my needs,"I downloaded the Free version, and of course the Developer IMMEDIATELY kept deluging me with the ""Buy the $10 Pro-Full version""; (WHY do they DO that right from the start, when you haven't even had time to try it out yet? Stupid Annoying marketing). I used it a few times a day to see if it was what I wanted, because I do not like the AMAZON WPS product included in my FIRE HDX 7 Tablet at all. After about a week or so, Developer offered the Full-Pro version, for half price, so I purchased it.The only thing that I haven't been able to find is How To Send and Store all my filesÂ  to Amazon Prime Cloud, which I desire, because the HDX that I have only allows internal total user storage up to about 11.5GB. Maybe the feature is in the APP somewhere and I just haven't found it yet... Thus, 5 Star instead of a 4 star rating given.(Come On Amazon, When areÂ  you going to update your rating system to allow Half Stars? Very,Very few man-made creations are 'Perfect' and deserving of a 5 Star!)",,,,negative

This version of Skype app for Fire is only OK.It works well for making outgoing video/voice calls, and texts.If the Fire is locked, incoming calls/texts aren't notified and don't appear until you unlock and open the Skype app, at which time they appear as missed calls.IF the app is OPEN and TOPMOST on the screen (or the top app in the open-app-stack), it works fine for incoming calls. Incoming text messages appear almost instantly, but without any sound notification, so you need to watch the screen if you're expecting a message.If the app is either not running at all or not on the top of the open-app-stack, incoming calls aren't notified at all.Also, even if the app is open and topmost on the screen, calls to a Skype phone number from a mobile or landline phone (as opposed to from a Skype contact) don't appear on the Fire (but you do eventually get a ""missed call"" indicator).All-in-all it appears to be well behind the Skype app on other devices; I don't know if that is because development is lagging or because the Fire simply doesn't have the capability to respond to incoming notifications.",,,,negative

Watersprite,1.0 out of 5 stars,Prefer vsee to Skype now,"I hadn't signed in for years, and had trouble this time because they had been bought by Microsoft and changed by Skype password to my hotmail password.Â  I didn't know this, and in resetting my skype password, also changed my hotmail password.Â  Then it took a long time to load before finally telling me that it didn't like my version of Firefox, and suggesting other browsers.Â  So I went in through IE.Â  Then it said that was no good, and I tried Chrome.Â  I couldn't find anywhere on the interface to click to startÂ  talking to someone through their computer (rather than calling a phone number).Â  Why do people use Skype to call phone numbers?Â  I can do that from my phone for no extra charge. So I gave up & installed vsee and it downloaded fast and connected right away.Â  And the user interface is self-evident.",,,,negative

Lydia Colton,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Clever skype, skewing your own feedback ;)","Skype cuts out alot, the auditory is not good, the visual is not good. I've noticed that, conveniently, skype prompts me for feedback after a call - for a long call, more than for a short call.Â  Naturally, if I have a long call, then the connection was probably sound. Otherwise, if it cuts out or the visual is so terrible, I disconnect and re-dial the person, resulting in a series of shorter calls - for which skype does not as frequently prompt me for feedback. Oooh, how convenient for you skype! Ask me for feedback coincidentally for long calls - which due to their length of time, probably went well - and refrain from prompting feedback when there is a series of short calls, demonstrating a poorly working call.Obviously, I give feedback on my own through both skype itself - and on here, like now - but still, skype, I think you are skewing your own data on purpose.",,,,negative
Mr. Sweet,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointed Paying Skype Customer + Update,Paying Skype customer for years.Â  It was great but just gets worse.Â  Skype for my most recent Fire tablet never rings when someone calls.Â  Tried everything and then tried everything again.Â  Been through the support threads.Â  It worked fine on my older Fire.Â  It seems to be an issue with many Android and Fire tablets.Â  Also this is the worst version of Skype and hard to use. Tried a couple of free phone programs apps similar to Skype and they work just fine.Â  Very disappointed.Update.Â  Skype has had a fairly substantial update since my last review.Â  Now it rings and sometime I can answer the call successfully.Â  Often it just closes and disconnects.Â  Hard to get to messages and sometimes impossible.Â  Now when I make a call there is no ring sound. only silence until someone answers so hard to tell if it had dialed out and connected.Â  I miss the good ol' days when skype worked well.Update: Guess what... it's worse.,,,,negative

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very glitchy.,"I'm sorry I'm having to post this to you, but I want to get this off my chest, this Skype is the worst one I'm using, it is so glitchy, calls would last for 1 second, a lot of messages would appear in random places I'm not sure what's going on, my friend is also having a lot of problems with your app too where when she makes a call it starts flashing black on her phone she's even told me that you haven't responded to her messages. ( btw Skype calls wouldn't last a second for me I forgot to put it there, but for some reason I can't go back to fix it. ) I think you guys might need to fix these problems on your app. I'm not saying your app isn't all that bad because I get to make more groups and do a bit more stuff than others, and I do think this app will have a lot of potential there's just a lot of stuff that needs to be fixed badly. I still do use it, but its the only thing I can use for right now.",,,,negative

M. T. Crenshaw,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Happy with voice calls, but app needs updating","UPDATE 8/11/2016After writing my review below I have been experiencing problems with Skype on PC after five minutes after connecting.Â  I hear the voice of the other person, but the other person does not hear mine. Also the line has started to drop. I keep my app updated in my PC and was quite satisfied with it until say the last month, when having a chat online has becoming too much of a hassle on my PC, but if I use my Skype for Android I have no problem.Please fix the app for PC, otherwise is worthless at present.PREVIOUS REVIEWI have used Skype since it first saw the light, many years ago. IÂ  have it installed in my computers and gadgets. I use it all the time. In my PC at least once a month for intercontinental chat about 1-2 hours long.Regarding Skype for PC, I am mostly happy with it. The quality of the sound is usually very good, with no return sound or delays nowadays, which used to happen often in the past. The line drops at times but rarely. In the last year, using this app *at least* once a month, I have had a bad experience just once.My main problem with the app is for voice+audio chats, as it is a pain in the butt: frozen images, or very slow movement or very bad quality image. I don't know if it is related to my Internet carrier or not, but it is most annoying. The result is that I don't make video-calls any more.Skype's interface for PC is a bit outdated, not clear enough and not customer friendly enough. The home screen should clearly show the options, voice call, video call, written chat alone, send photo and/or doco, plus the contact list on the side bar.My account is totally private, only close friends and family are there, I cannot be found by name or email. Yet, sometimes I get requests of people I don't know, spammers I guess, so I would like that scam to be out of my house and the portholes taking them there locked.I like that Skype asks me about the quality of the sound and call/video-call when I finish. At least they care!Â  I think that serves to improve the service and is specially important when I have a bad experience.",,,,negative

To make the matter worse - the is no option to delete the from the screen either.And now the most important issue that mames this Skype update totally worthless - you CAN NOT see which of your contacts is online. The green light feature is gone, it doesn't appear even on Skype echo which is always online. They need to fix that bug,obviously. It is a bug, because yesterday i did see that green light at some point, and after i closed the app and opened it again - it was blind as usual.Please fix it!",,,,negative

James,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad port of a good service.,"The worst aspect of this app is that it continually fails to push messages from people. Often I will message someone only to suddenly have several messages sent to me hours before suddenly load. To the other people, it just appears I am ignoring them. Signing on to the desktop app at the same time will make the messages show up and be received immediately, but then what is the point of using the app if I have to use the desktop?The interface was already bad and they continue to make it worse with each update. Now contacts are separated into a long alphabetical directory rather than simply allowing you to see who is online at a glance. The desktop interface is fine, and I'm not sure why they feel the need to try and deviate from it.You cannot choose any status but online or invisible. Worse, you can't see if anyone else has their status set as away or busy. You simply see them as online, when in reality they may not want to be disturbed.The desktop program is fine. The mobile app however is handicapped in several ways. If you need a way to use Skype from your phone or tablet, this is unfortunately your best option. If you are just looking for a video/instant messaging app that doesn't need to be Skype, then choose something else.",,,,negative

Yvette Zarate,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it, but.... (Kindle Fire HD)","On the app, calls can only be viewed on one landscape for viewing. This is one of those incredible inconveniences of many Kindle Fire HD apps.... the charging port is on the ""right side"" aka bottom, when in landscape mode. this makes it impossible to prop up to view talks and charge your device at the same time. What's worse, if it's plugged in and you lay out flat, the device goes to sleep.It's a small gripe for all its benefits, great streaming, incredible video quality, but on those extra long talks with a friend 9 hours ahead in a different country, it's a bummer to have to end the call based on a small inconvenience. BUT,Â  on the plus side, to be able to video chat for 4 plus hours on a full charge is amazing.Please consider making one mode universal to the device orientation, whether it is propped up ""upright"" or ""upside down""",,,,negative

They all have problems, crashing all the time and making you sorry you bought a kindle and not a Nexus or something different form another manufacturer that can download from the official Google Play Store.Skype is one of those failures, when a nice app you love just drives you crazy for the sake of Amazon's own version of Android. I'm not sure they're aware the ammount of trouble they're causing with that. They think this is the way to capture more customers, but they're totally wrong. And since I hate being forced to buy something that doesn't work, I use alternative stores, even if I can't use the Google Play Store.I updated Skype using a version I found in another store and it works perfectly.

For calling computer to landline from overseas, my calls are are almost routinely dropped or there's a clicking noise on the line; and usually one side or the other can't make out parts of the conversation.

Allen F.Â  & Virginia S.Â  Capel,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work for me,"This will be my third Skype account.Â  So far none of them work properly.Â  My first attempt with Skype was about five years ago and it worked perfectly.Â  Since then, it is constantly degraded to the point where I get garbled sound and no video.Â  I thought by having it on my Kindle.Â  My problem would be resolved.Â  No such luck.Â  I think Skype just does not like me.Â  I know it is not my Internet connection because the next step up would be to full commercial satellite receiving.Â  It does work okay for instant message, though, but that's not why I bought it.Â  Yes, I even purchased an upgrade version for my computer and it still does not work.Â  Skype and me just don't agree.Â  I sure hope someone from Skype reads this review and offers me some help because their customer service is probably the worst in the industry",,,,negative
Fernando Garcia,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lower than 1 Star,"This is the most frustrating app I have ever used.Â  I can video chat on average, 3-4 minutes before the call will drop.Â  Unfortunately, that is only about a 3 of 10 on the frustration level that this app is about to take me on.Â  After the call drops, I recall the person I was talking to only to get a black screen.Â  I can't end the call, I can't back out of it, I can only wait until the app decides it is not working correctly and gives me an error message with the option to wait or end the app.Â  Ending the app will take you back to the main page where you can either try and call the person back and repeat the black screen of Skype purgatory or exit the app completely.Â  So after surviving Skype purgatory and fully exciting the app, you think, okay let's try this again.Â  Maybe exiting the app has reset it and I can get another 3-4 minutes of video time.Â  You enter the app, everything looks good, you dial and find yourself immersed back into blackness and understand that you are not in Skype purgatory but in the depths of Skype hell where no calls are ever made and you are doomed to relive the same horrors again and again.Â  The only escape is to restart your system and stay far away from icy grips of Skype Lucifer.Â  Heed the warning and flee from this app as it only brings darkness and gnashing of teeth.",,,,negative
Manny,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst POS app I have ever installed.,"I bought a kindle for my mother-in-law so that she could skype with us. A fire HD. I have spent over 10 hours trying to get this to work - can't get past signing in. All I ever see is ""you are already on line'"". Went on the net to see if anyone else was having a similar problem. Ha - almost half the users have the same problem. I am an IT guy - over twenty years in the field. I did everything right (and several times). This app is garbage, complete garbage. I would send the kindle back (it's the main reason I bought it) but too much time has passed. If you're considering buying a kindle for this purpose, think again - find an alternative because this simply does not work. Shame on Amazon for even allowing Skype to be presented as an option. Very, very disappointing.",,,,negative

Once it gives you the error message if you don't close it, it'll crash your system. Freezes the screen, and you have to full power down. The only reason I bothered to review and rate one star at all is voice calling is superbly clear with minimal lag.Â  However two minutes into my voice call (because I gave up on video), I got the error that Skype was not responding.Â  My screen then froze completely.

When I receive a call and need to unlock my Kindle, Skype crashes and I receive an error message that simply reads ""Skype has stopped."" I wouldn't even be writing this review if it didn't happen EVERY SINGLE TIME.Another small complaint is that it takes far too long to sign in.

If you don't close it, the same message will keep popping up, therefore FORCING you to close it. If you have an older version of Skype, keep it.

Linda,2.0 out of 5 stars,No. Just NO.,"I used to like Skype. A lot. But after it got updated, I HATE IT. Now I can't multitask as much anymore (as in talking on Skype and doing something else). Sometimes when I'm talking with someone on Skype and I go off the app to another one, it stops and disconnects my call. Yes, the appearance looks better, but technological wise, it sucks. Please get the bugs fix :/ I hate it. The camera on Skype is disoriented for my Kindle Fire. I thought maybe it was my device or internet connection, but I tried restarting it and everything, but the condition still is the same. It's bad for me that's why I'm leaving a review for those of you who haven't updated Skype yet to NOT UPDATE IT. Hopefully it gets better so I can change the star ratings :/",,,,negative

Dauphinty,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a working app.Â  Will not allow area code to be entered,"I am really peeved that the Skype download for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 does not allow for you to add the area/local code, so that you can obtain a number for your device on the local network.Â  This renders video chatting with other friends on Skype useless, since they have no contact number with which to reach you.Â  I tried to delete it twice and reload the application, and even tried the android application.Â  Nothing I did corrected the problem.Â  If you don't put the area code in and just have the state, like Texas, it gives you a phone area code for San Antonio, which is 5 hours away.Â  Someone needs to seriously look at this and make a correction to the app., or give us a way to fix it.Â  Skype is one of the main video chatting apps that most people use.Â  Had I known it was useless I would have spent my money on the Ipad, but i figured all i needed was to video chat and didn't need to have a camera on the back for vidoes and pictures that the Ipad includes.Â  At least Ipad can use SKYPE!Â  I'd give this app a zero if it allowed....",,,,negative

The microphone works well and does not appear to pick up too much surrounding noise.

I recently signed up for Skype Premium so I could group chat with my sons who live in different states. They both have Kindle Fire HD's. What a waste of $10?! At least I didn't pay for the whole year up front, I guess. Many of the reviews about Skype I have read were posted by folds who signed up for the entire year! After about 30 minutes of trying and having various issues, we gave up and I started doing some researching. We also had various other issues with Skype when trying to video chat one-on-one.

Solaris,1.0 out of 5 stars,New Updates,"So got my kindle for Christmas and was happy that it came with this app cause I finally had a mobile Skype. Didn't enjoy the fact that if I had my keyboard up in the IMs that I couldn't see if someone was messaging me, from what my sister says she has the same problem on her phone. I learned to deal with it, simply close the keyboard randomly to check if that orange ""1"" is flashing. Most annoying was that even if I signed out Skype would still display me as online causing me to uninstall the app whenever I didn't want to appear online.Fast forward to today and I download Skype to find it has a new update,and a crappy one at that. Now it has ""tablet mode"" and ""smart phone mode"" which are supposed to be ""optimized"" for that type of device. Which is an outright lite given that I'm on a kindle and using the smartphone mode because it's the only one that flips with the screen. Why they removed the screen matching the position of the tablet but kept it for the phone is beyond me.While a complete and utter bell/whistle they even removed the profile picture that appears next to the person's name while in chat.",,,,negative
ijess,1.0 out of 5 stars,Skype/useless,"I got a kindle to take travelling with me, partly to use Skype to keep in touch with home. All worked brilliantly till an automatic up date, supposedly making Skype better for the tablet, downloaded it's self. I've paid to have a number on Skype and do use credit to make some calls and send texts, but I've found that being a paying customer means nothing to Skype, I am evidently worthless to them.Â  It was near impossible to contact anyone at Skype, it's really hard to get to the point that you can actually communicate with someone and when I finally did they weren't helpful at all.Â  So I got in touch with Amazon, they were great and gave me a way to overcome the problems I've been having. Albeit a temporary fix.The problems I've had have included, not being able to sign in, the control panel disappearing so I cannot sign in or out (once signed out automatically there was no way to sign back in), see what credit I have or access my profile. Losing all records of any texts that I have sent and paid for. The programme constantly crashes.Having got home from travelling I have again contacted Skype to try and resolve the problem.Â  Several emails have been exchanged, they have collected data from me about the problem and now have closed the case without having resolved the problem at all. I have lost money because of the problems I've had, directly from my Skype credit, I shall never see that again.Â  Skype is a disgrace, if anything goes wrong with the programme they are useless, it appears to be a waste of time contacting them, they don't understand their own product.",,,,negative

I really have been nothing but disappointed in this product.

What bothers me is since the updates it's like this program isn't even made for my kindle,crash crash crash crash crash. Thats the story of my life nowadays. You pretty much cannot access any other program while it's running even though it keeps it running in a pic in pic screen in the corner. If you do it will......whats that folks?......CRASH. Absolutely the most useless program on the planet. I plan to sell my kindle back to amazon as soon as I get home for the measily 56 bucks they are offering after my 7 months of ownership and I am buying a IPAD thats right I said it. At least I know face time is reliable and wont drop after 1 to two seconds of use. This is truely a pathetic product and should be an embarassment to amazon.

Rihanna Wallace,1.0 out of 5 stars,Update Ruined Skype,"Since Skype has been updated I've faced a bunch of problems. One problem is that the volume is high, it doesn't matter if I put the volume on zero I can still hear the person on the other line loudly. Another problem that I have is that as soon as you click on the app it signs in automatically. If someone was to click on my Skype they would be able to access my messages and contacts immediately.Â  I want my privacy. Another problem is that it continuously crashes for no apparent reason. One minutes it's working and the next it's sending you a message that says ""Skype is not responding would you like to close it"" if you say yes it closes and if you don't the message will continue to pop up. Before the update I also noticed that Skype would just hang up my calls and I thought it was my internet connection but after reading numerous reviews I realize that I'm not the only one with this problem. Skype needs to be fixed immediately. The company should fix all the glitches before putting it back in the Appstore.",,,,negative

William Overman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but weak on handling of incoming calls.","I'm using this app on a Kindle Fire HD 7.Skype, in general, is excellent. This version of Skype app for Fire is only OK.It works well for making outgoing video/voice calls, and texts.If the Fire is locked, incoming calls/texts aren't notified and don't appear until you unlock and open the Skype app, at which time they appear as missed calls.IF the app is OPEN and TOPMOST on the screen (or the top app in the open-app-stack), it works fine for incoming calls. Incoming text messages appear almost instantly, but without any sound notification, so you need to watch the screen if you're expecting a message.If the app is either not running at all or not on the top of the open-app-stack, incoming calls aren't notified at all.Also, even if the app is open and topmost on the screen, calls to a Skype phone number from a mobile or landline phone (as opposed to from a Skype contact) don't appear on the Fire (but you do eventually get a ""missed call"" indicator).All-in-all it appears to be well behind the Skype app on other devices; I don't know if that is because development is lagging or because the Fire simply doesn't have the capability to respond to incoming notifications.",,,,negative

Lydia Colton,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Clever skype, skewing your own feedback ;)","Skype cuts out alot, the auditory is not good, the visual is not good. I've noticed that, conveniently, skype prompts me for feedback after a call - for a long call, more than for a short call.Â  Naturally, if I have a long call, then the connection was probably sound. Otherwise, if it cuts out or the visual is so terrible, I disconnect and re-dial the person, resulting in a series of shorter calls - for which skype does not as frequently prompt me for feedback. Oooh, how convenient for you skype! Ask me for feedback coincidentally for long calls - which due to their length of time, probably went well - and refrain from prompting feedback when there is a series of short calls, demonstrating a poorly working call.Obviously, I give feedback on my own through both skype itself - and on here, like now - but still, skype, I think you are skewing your own data on purpose.",,,,negative
Mr. Sweet,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointed Paying Skype Customer + Update,Paying Skype customer for years.Â  It was great but just gets worse.Â  Skype for my most recent Fire tablet never rings when someone calls.Â  Tried everything and then tried everything again.Â  Been through the support threads.Â  It worked fine on my older Fire.Â  It seems to be an issue with many Android and Fire tablets.Â  Also this is the worst version of Skype and hard to use. Tried a couple of free phone programs apps similar to Skype and they work just fine.Â  Very disappointed.Update.Â  Skype has had a fairly substantial update since my last review.Â  Now it rings and sometime I can answer the call successfully.Â  Often it just closes and disconnects.Â  Hard to get to messages and sometimes impossible.Â  Now when I make a call there is no ring sound. only silence until someone answers so hard to tell if it had dialed out and connected.Â  I miss the good ol' days when skype worked well.Update: Guess what... it's worse.,,,,negative
janette lopez,1.0 out of 5 stars,not like it used to be,No clear guide on how to get to the page where you can make calls.

M. T. Crenshaw,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Happy with voice calls, but app needs updating","UPDATE 8/11/2016After writing my review below I have been experiencing problems with Skype on PC after five minutes after connecting.Â  I hear the voice of the other person, but the other person does not hear mine. Also the line has started to drop. I keep my app updated in my PC and was quite satisfied with it until say the last month, when having a chat online has becoming too much of a hassle on my PC, but if I use my Skype for Android I have no problem.Please fix the app for PC, otherwise is worthless at present.PREVIOUS REVIEWI have used Skype since it first saw the light, many years ago. IÂ  have it installed in my computers and gadgets. I use it all the time. In my PC at least once a month for intercontinental chat about 1-2 hours long.Regarding Skype for PC, I am mostly happy with it. The quality of the sound is usually very good, with no return sound or delays nowadays, which used to happen often in the past. The line drops at times but rarely. In the last year, using this app *at least* once a month, I have had a bad experience just once.My main problem with the app is for voice+audio chats, as it is a pain in the butt: frozen images, or very slow movement or very bad quality image. I don't know if it is related to my Internet carrier or not, but it is most annoying. The result is that I don't make video-calls any more.Skype's interface for PC is a bit outdated, not clear enough and not customer friendly enough. The home screen should clearly show the options, voice call, video call, written chat alone, send photo and/or doco, plus the contact list on the side bar.My account is totally private, only close friends and family are there, I cannot be found by name or email. Yet, sometimes I get requests of people I don't know, spammers I guess, so I would like that scam to be out of my house and the portholes taking them there locked.I like that Skype asks me about the quality of the sound and call/video-call when I finish. At least they care!Â  I think that serves to improve the service and is specially important when I have a bad experience.",,,,negative

Marco Brooks,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mobile app became unusable after recent update,"Last week my mobile Skype decided to update on its own without even asking my permission to do so as any other app would do. Update brought back bunch of garbage from 2 years of prior communications, including all of the blocked and deleted people and bots! To make the matter worse - the is no option to delete the from the screen either.And now the most important issue that mames this Skype update totally worthless - you CAN NOT see which of your contacts is online. The green light feature is gone, it doesn't appear even on Skype echo which is always online. They need to fix that bug,obviously. It is a bug, because yesterday i did see that green light at some point, and after i closed the app and opened it again - it was blind as usual.Please fix it!",,,,negative

James,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad port of a good service.,"The worst aspect of this app is that it continually fails to push messages from people. Often I will message someone only to suddenly have several messages sent to me hours before suddenly load. To the other people, it just appears I am ignoring them. Signing on to the desktop app at the same time will make the messages show up and be received immediately, but then what is the point of using the app if I have to use the desktop?The interface was already bad and they continue to make it worse with each update. Now contacts are separated into a long alphabetical directory rather than simply allowing you to see who is online at a glance. The desktop interface is fine, and I'm not sure why they feel the need to try and deviate from it.You cannot choose any status but online or invisible. Worse, you can't see if anyone else has their status set as away or busy. You simply see them as online, when in reality they may not want to be disturbed.The desktop program is fine. The mobile app however is handicapped in several ways. If you need a way to use Skype from your phone or tablet, this is unfortunately your best option. If you are just looking for a video/instant messaging app that doesn't need to be Skype, then choose something else.",,,,negative

They all have problems, crashing all the time and making you sorry you bought a kindle and not a Nexus or something different form another manufacturer that can download from the official Google Play Store.Skype is one of those failures, when a nice app you love just drives you crazy for the sake of Amazon's own version of Android. I'm not sure they're aware the ammount of trouble they're causing with that. They think this is the way to capture more customers, but they're totally wrong. And since I hate being forced to buy something that doesn't work, I use alternative stores, even if I can't use the Google Play Store.I updated Skype using a version I found in another store and it works perfectly.

For calling computer to landline from overseas, my calls are are almost routinely dropped or there's a clicking noise on the line; and usually one side or the other can't make out parts of the conversation.

Fernando Garcia,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lower than 1 Star,"This is the most frustrating app I have ever used.Â  I can video chat on average, 3-4 minutes before the call will drop.Â  Unfortunately, that is only about a 3 of 10 on the frustration level that this app is about to take me on.Â  After the call drops, I recall the person I was talking to only to get a black screen.Â  I can't end the call, I can't back out of it, I can only wait until the app decides it is not working correctly and gives me an error message with the option to wait or end the app.Â  Ending the app will take you back to the main page where you can either try and call the person back and repeat the black screen of Skype purgatory or exit the app completely.Â  So after surviving Skype purgatory and fully exciting the app, you think, okay let's try this again.Â  Maybe exiting the app has reset it and I can get another 3-4 minutes of video time.Â  You enter the app, everything looks good, you dial and find yourself immersed back into blackness and understand that you are not in Skype purgatory but in the depths of Skype hell where no calls are ever made and you are doomed to relive the same horrors again and again.Â  The only escape is to restart your system and stay far away from icy grips of Skype Lucifer.Â  Heed the warning and flee from this app as it only brings darkness and gnashing of teeth.",,,,negative

Ramgoat,1.0 out of 5 stars,Annoyed and Disappointed,"Let's just get this straight: Skype for Kindle Fire HD is probably one of the WORST apps to ever exist. The calls drop, my kindle freezes, I haveÂ  to restart kindle, I can't see their face, or I can't hear them. The only thing it does correctly is the messaging. But I don't want Skype for messaging. There are tons of messaging apps out there. I wanted it for voice calls. The updates just keep making the product worse and worse.

THE Food Ninja,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well for the most part, but...","For the most part, Skype works well on my Kindle Fire HD. Have tested it out in different locations and I've conceded at this point that my dropped calls at home are due to my questionable internet service provider. HOWEVER -- Skype ALWAYS crashes if I'm signed-in to Skype and (like most people) put the Kindle in sleep mode when not in use with it password enabled. When I receive a call and need to unlock my Kindle, Skype crashes and I receive an error message that simply reads ""Skype has stopped."" I wouldn't even be writing this review if it didn't happen EVERY SINGLE TIME.Another small complaint is that it takes far too long to sign in. I'm waiting in excess of 30 seconds during the sign-in process. It takes a fraction of that time on the mobile version and the PC version. It is in my personal opinion that the Kindle version needs MUCH improvement.I'd be interested to know if any others are experiencing the crashing problem or if it's just me.",,,,negative

If you don't close it, the same message will keep popping up, therefore FORCING you to close it. If you have an older version of Skype, keep it.

pete,1.0 out of 5 stars,disappointing,"Have used this app before with limited success on an Android phone. Got it again pre-installed on my Kindle but due to usage issues I don't go on often enough to remember my password. I attempted creating a new account as it would not send a ""forgot password"" email and the app refused to cooperate. No matter what or how many characters I used for a password it insisted it was always too short, it managed to change my user name to something completely off the wall (which was not a result of any text autocorrect), and sadly, was just an overall useless app at a moment when it was a personally importantÂ  to have. I will be researching other video chat/text apps that I'm certain will be less headache to use.",,,,negative

I tried this for about three or four months; people would call and the programming is so poor that it can't even stay loaded to receive calls. Only good to attempt out-bound calls, only stays loaded for a few hours at most before crashing, barely dependable as anything more than an empty claim.It's clearlyÂ  aÂ  conspiracy by Microsoft--introduce an app on another operating system (not Microsoft) and use it as a platform to say that Android is unstable--there Are lots of applications that stay loaded dependably,Â  you just don't know what you're doing",,,,negative

Sean Gately,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's a dud... Come on Skype,"I'm hoping the product manager from the Skype Android app team reads reviews because this app needs help. On my KINDLE Fire HD the app will freeze, or the camera will freeze and then crash every time we use it. The volume when connected is absurdly low, and the other party complains about the picture flipping. One of the more (if there can be more) annoying parts of this spp is the constant beeping while the camera app tries to adjust to light and dark, and resizes the image box that shows the view of herself.Come on Skype! I have never had an issue with the ios version of Skype, and this version has so many bugs it feels like it was done on purpose to send us running to Apple.",,,,negative

Connected without a problem, but the picture quality was very poor, the voice transmission was spotty at best and the call couldn't stay connected. Was it our Wifi? Well, we disconnected the Skype call and dialed up via Facetime and had no problems at all. I'd say it was the Skype.",,,,negative
Jessica,1.0 out of 5 stars,TIRED OF IT.,"Just about every time I get logged out of Skype, I put in my correct information in, over and over, and it wants to tell me my username/password are incorrect. Then, I have to go through the whole process of the email and sometimes when I request an email, it doesn't come for DAYS. No. It hasn't happened just once or twice. It's happened 5-10 times. I've had difficulty logging in at least 30 times since I've had the Skype app. Which is probably about 2 months. I am tired of going through this crap. I've even had to make several accounts because of never get an email multiple times.",,,,negative
Michael Johnston,1.0 out of 5 stars,problematic,Skype worked great until the latest update. Beeps every time the video has a glitch. Beeps everytime I switch between landscape and portrait mode.

I recently signed up for Skype Premium so I could group chat with my sons who live in different states. They both have Kindle Fire HD's. What a waste of $10?! At least I didn't pay for the whole year up front, I guess. Many of the reviews about Skype I have read were posted by folds who signed up for the entire year! After about 30 minutes of trying and having various issues, we gave up and I started doing some researching. We also had various other issues with Skype when trying to video chat one-on-one.

Solaris,1.0 out of 5 stars,New Updates,"So got my kindle for Christmas and was happy that it came with this app cause I finally had a mobile Skype. Didn't enjoy the fact that if I had my keyboard up in the IMs that I couldn't see if someone was messaging me, from what my sister says she has the same problem on her phone. I learned to deal with it, simply close the keyboard randomly to check if that orange ""1"" is flashing. Most annoying was that even if I signed out Skype would still display me as online causing me to uninstall the app whenever I didn't want to appear online.Fast forward to today and I download Skype to find it has a new update,and a crappy one at that. Now it has ""tablet mode"" and ""smart phone mode"" which are supposed to be ""optimized"" for that type of device. Which is an outright lite given that I'm on a kindle and using the smartphone mode because it's the only one that flips with the screen. Why they removed the screen matching the position of the tablet but kept it for the phone is beyond me.While a complete and utter bell/whistle they even removed the profile picture that appears next to the person's name while in chat.",,,,negative
ijess,1.0 out of 5 stars,Skype/useless,"I got a kindle to take travelling with me, partly to use Skype to keep in touch with home. All worked brilliantly till an automatic up date, supposedly making Skype better for the tablet, downloaded it's self. I've paid to have a number on Skype and do use credit to make some calls and send texts, but I've found that being a paying customer means nothing to Skype, I am evidently worthless to them.Â  It was near impossible to contact anyone at Skype, it's really hard to get to the point that you can actually communicate with someone and when I finally did they weren't helpful at all.Â  So I got in touch with Amazon, they were great and gave me a way to overcome the problems I've been having. Albeit a temporary fix.The problems I've had have included, not being able to sign in, the control panel disappearing so I cannot sign in or out (once signed out automatically there was no way to sign back in), see what credit I have or access my profile. Losing all records of any texts that I have sent and paid for. The programme constantly crashes.Having got home from travelling I have again contacted Skype to try and resolve the problem.Â  Several emails have been exchanged, they have collected data from me about the problem and now have closed the case without having resolved the problem at all. I have lost money because of the problems I've had, directly from my Skype credit, I shall never see that again.Â  Skype is a disgrace, if anything goes wrong with the programme they are useless, it appears to be a waste of time contacting them, they don't understand their own product.",,,,negative

What bothers me is since the updates it's like this program isn't even made for my kindle,crash crash crash crash crash. Thats the story of my life nowadays. You pretty much cannot access any other program while it's running even though it keeps it running in a pic in pic screen in the corner. If you do it will......whats that folks?......CRASH. Absolutely the most useless program on the planet. I plan to sell my kindle back to amazon as soon as I get home for the measily 56 bucks they are offering after my 7 months of ownership and I am buying a IPAD thats right I said it. At least I know face time is reliable and wont drop after 1 to two seconds of use. This is truely a pathetic product and should be an embarassment to amazon.

Rihanna Wallace,1.0 out of 5 stars,Update Ruined Skype,"Since Skype has been updated I've faced a bunch of problems. One problem is that the volume is high, it doesn't matter if I put the volume on zero I can still hear the person on the other line loudly. Another problem that I have is that as soon as you click on the app it signs in automatically. If someone was to click on my Skype they would be able to access my messages and contacts immediately.Â  I want my privacy. Another problem is that it continuously crashes for no apparent reason. One minutes it's working and the next it's sending you a message that says ""Skype is not responding would you like to close it"" if you say yes it closes and if you don't the message will continue to pop up. Before the update I also noticed that Skype would just hang up my calls and I thought it was my internet connection but after reading numerous reviews I realize that I'm not the only one with this problem. Skype needs to be fixed immediately. The company should fix all the glitches before putting it back in the Appstore.",,,,negative

Susan Wilen,3.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting....,"Although I love having goals, I found this website a little off-putting when I was reminded at 11 pm that I had my quota of French yet to be met.Â  Although I had targeted 10 minutes per day for study, it many times took me 45 minutes to complete the two lessons each day, not something that inspires confidence.Â  I also found it difficult when new words or phrases would be randomly introduced without any predicate.Â  Considering that you have three possible mistakes in the course of 20 questions, new words at the end of a difficult sequence forced me to start again.Â  Slight spelling typos were also problematic when my i-Phone keyboard auto-corrected.Â  Although I love this concept, I think the program needs work.",,,,negative

With Italian and French, fortunately I'd studied them earlier and just needed a refresher.Â  With Spanish, I passed all Duolingo's lessons with aces, and went well into the upper levels, but was basically unable to understand when I got to Spain or Mexico.Â  A program that teaches neither vocabulary nor grammar in any detail is useless in practice.",,,,negative

For a start this app was very dictatorial, it uses games to teach, the problem is these games introduce articles of grammar in its question which it has not yet taught you. So in affect you keep getting the question wrong because the new learner has not yet learned what it is asking. secondly It does not teach the usual way of learning basic people introducing each in every day conversation. Instead it dives straight into list of words detached from everyday communication and conversation. Plus it had no repeat slowly or pronunciation guide, it just throws words at you pronounced so fast you don't understand what was said and you can not go back to a question.

You are expected to 'absorb' this...along wit the various verb forms and tenses...the different prepositions...weak/strong nouns....word order....need I go on? You NEED to be taught the niceties of grammar!....If you have a query you can ask other users for help - but they may be just as confused as you. In some cases they most definitely are confused!

KSM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Using it 32 consecutive days & counting! Need prior knowledge! You will learn spelling and grammer! But doesn't explain/teach!,"Over 20 years ago, I lived in Italy for 4 years (not consecutive) and had several group lessons but despite the efforts of my various instructors, I just didn't have the patience to learn the grammar.Â  My knowledge of vocabulary was good enough for me to communicate and function but I never could get the hang of conjugating verbs, learning about the articles, and spelling words properly.Â  Later lived in Latin America for 4 years and that messed up my language skills big time!Â  So, now I speak both languages very poorly - just throwing out words to make a mishmash sentence.Â  A couple years ago I went back to Italy and they asked me if I could speak english because they couldn't tell if I spoke Spanish, Italian or some unknown language!Â  (Note: My native language is American English)So, I'm returning to Italy again for a 2 week vacation and I'm determined to be better this time and not embarrass myself.Â  So, I got Duolingo on Feb 20th and believe it or not, I'm truly addicted to the program!Â  I have a full time job and when I come home I'm tired and yet, every single day, I spend 1 hour to 2 hours working on these mini lessons from Duolingo!Â  Funny, they are kind of addictive.Â  They force you to learn the language by making you hear the language, speak the language, interpret the phrase back and forth between languages, to spell it properly, and put it in the correct order.Â  If you do it wrong more than 3x then, it kicks you out of the lesson and makes you start over, but the lesson is different the next time around.Â  Now, you would think one would get discouraged, I mean, I've had to redo some lessons about 6x, and yet, somehow, the way it is structured, it makes me want to keep at it and do it right!Â  I mean it is working on me, one of the most stubborn learners!So there are a multitude of topics at every level (beginning/intermediate/advanced) and within each topic they have 4-8 different minilessons in each topic.Â  It visually has a graph that shows you where you are at.Â  And, even when you think you are done with a topic (whew), every couple of days, that topic reopens and they make you practice it again so you don't forget!Â  Wow!Â  So, even with my background knowledge/vocabulary of Italian, I'm still at the very end of the beginners (Level 8; 335 words!) and I've been working hard for a month!Â  Oh, another downer is I was working on it for 12 days and suddenly it reset and told me I was back on day 1.Â  I thought it did that every 12 days but now it says I'm at 16 days. (IF ANYONE READS THIS FROM DUOLINGO; I WANT IT RESET TO FEB 20TH THAT I'VE DONE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY!).The downside is that if you have never ever studied a latin language this would be super hard for you.Â  I think if you already know a similar language like spanish and how it is structured, it will be easier for you.Â  However, if you are a person who has never studied a romance language and absolute beginner that only knows Ciao, etc..and hever had a lesson, then, you will have a hard time.Â  Also, if you are a miserable speller in your native language, learning to spell Italian will kill you because it is so difficult to get all of the vowels in the right place.Â  I have many times translated a very complicated sentence from english to Italian, only to get it counted wrong cuz I misspelled 1 letter!Â  But, it forces me to really think what I'm writing and how it all comes together to form a complete sentence.Â  Also, it really doesn't teach you the vocabulary or the grammar rules, at all.Â  I kept failing the lesson because I wasn't sure what some articles meant because they seem to mean different things at different times.Â  Yesterday, I finally broke down and got a grammar book so I can look up what all of the articles mean.Â  So, this program works for people who are already familiar.Â  I'm worried that when I get in the more immediate level, I might need to study before using this as it isn't really a good teacher - doesn't explain or introduce new concepts.Â  Good for people that really want to tighten up what they already know and go farther.",,,,negative

My problem comes when I'm in the middle of a lesson and all of a sudden it goes back to the menu. I'm using kindle fire HDX so I don't know if that has something to do with it.

stayathomedad,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed,"Biggest issue I have with it isn't so much that I have trouble learning the languages (I don't), it's that it gives no platform or basis to draw from.Â  For example, I took three years of HS German and did a study abroad in Germany.Â  My German isn't good, mostly bar talk and what not.Â  So yeah, I have a basis to draw from and can ""test out"" of certain sections, but if I didn't know the difference between I, you, he, she, it, we, you, and they, I'd have trouble with conjugation with no help and I see this when trying the Spanish on here (I took none, and my vocab is limited to Taco Bell and Sesame Street).Â  It doesn't try to teach you the language so much as add a few words and repetition to what you already have.Â  Will I continue to use it?Â  yeah, cause I haven't found anything really good to help as an option.Â  Will I recommend this to learn a language?

Backe Kuchen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Effective, but best with prior introduction to chosen language.","As other reviewers have stated, this app may not be ideal for learning a language without any prior knowledge of that language. This is due to a lack of grammatical instruction. However it is very useful as a refresher, or for those with a bare bones knowledge of a language. The only other con is the computer sounding voice that does not quite sound like a normal speaker. Overall I have found this app to work better for me than others I have tried.",,,,negative

Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Freaking Awesome!,"I've been using this app on my 7"" Kindle Fire HD and my HTC One SV for approximately a week... maybe a week and a half now, and I absolutely love it!I'm using it to learn German... not sure what other language options there are, although I know Spanish and French are in there. So far I am hugely impressed. The app uses a combination of written, spoken, and visual cues/questions... so one question may ask me to translate a sentence from German to English, the next question might be to translate something from English to German, and the question after that may be to speak a sentence in German or to write a sentence in German that the app speaks (the app's voice is not great, but definitely serviceable)... reinforced occasionally by visual cues such as labeled pictures (i.e. a picture of a dude labeled ""der Mann""... you get the idea after a bit).The teaching method works, I have to say... and this from a guy who always considered himself critically handicapped when it came to learning new languages.Â  Granted, I'm early into the program, but I am retaining a large part of each lesson, which is honestly more than I can say for my experience with Rosetta Stone.There are two cons that I've noted: First, and this may have been an individual problem, the app wouldn't let me sign in with either Google+ or Facebook... it has buttons for doing that, but they didn't work... so I had to go old-school and actually create a separate account.Â  Minor glitch, but still worth noting.Â  The second con is that in the course of the lessons, I haven't yet encountered a definitive explanation of certain rules of grammar, i.e. when to use one form or another of a verb. On one hand this is vaguely annoying, as I end up with wrong answers without being entirely certain why they're wrong; on the other hand, however, I suspect that this is actually increasing the effectiveness of the program, as this makes me really think about each word before I use it, and when I'm wrong, I really study WHY I was wrong, which ultimately increases retention of the language. So kudos for effectiveness, even if it is a bit annoying.Overall... freaking awesome.Â  Get this app.Â  I can't believe it's free, honestly, but as long as it is, get it!",,,,negative

Maybe because I learned French in Holland, even though I spent every summer for six years in southern Belgium and one summer in Paris. To make a long story short, I had to start with the basics to get used to the teacher's voice and accent. Now about the app. I am happy I downloaded it, and working rapidly through the lessons. It is a great program, but I am not sure if the microphone on my Kindle Fire HDX is working or not, when it asks for pronunciation of the phrases. I'll have to figure that out later.

Laura,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I am learning Spanish on Duolingo and I love it. It starts right from the beginning with very basic words but it does allow you to skip sections if you already know them. It allows for the fact that there may be more than one way of saying something and will mark you correct if you give any correct answer.Â  It doesn't mark you wrong for forgetting accents, although it does remind you when you get it wrong. You can report mistakes so the site/app is constantly improving. There is a discussion feature so that if you are confused about an answer you can see what other people have said about it. Often they give very detailed answers about Spanish grammar and about specific countries or situations where you would use words or phrases. The units are short so if you only have 5 minutes to spare you can complete one no problem. The only thing that is slightly inconvenient is that you have to be connected to the internet.

SuzyQ,5.0 out of 5 stars,The VERY BEST language learning app!,"I have had two years of French in school and used virtually every language program available. Here are my critiques:Rosetta Stone...didn't like that because it didn't present the material in a way that appealed to me or that stuck with me. Also, it frustrated me as it seemed disorganized and a backwards approach. Plus it's expensive. At least $400Â  for entire program. Pimsleur: it is pretty good actually. The one drawback to Pimsleur is that I sometimes can't understand exactly what they are saying, even after having two years of the language under my belt,Â  therefore, you don't get the concept of how the language is organized. Plus it is expensive. The pro to it though is that you can listen to the audio in your car or while cleaning house or jogging.FrenchPod: pros: you can download audio files to listen to wherever you are. The speakers haveÂ  a natural French dialog and then go over it bit by bit and explain the various uses of the words. You can alsodownload workbook pages to refer to.Cons: There us an extremely limited list of lessons, all of which are around 6 sentences to dissect. Also, there is no practice, either speaking or writing.Textbooks: Difficult. Boring.DuoLingo: pros:Â  you get to hear the audio spoken at a natural speed. Then you can slow it down so you can pick up on each word as it is enunciated. You are immersed in the language by having to type out, which forces you to remember placement of nouns and verbs etc.Â  It is formatted sort of like a game, so it doesn't feel much like work, and it is actually quite addictive. It's totally FREE! No ads either.Cons: it can get frustrating if you get an answer wrong because you miss points, so like with any ""game,"" you might get frustrated if you're that serious about game points.I have learned FAR more with this app in 6Â  months than I EVER learned in all my previous years using other methods!

Kate,3.0 out of 5 stars,i think u will find this review helpful,"yes, this is a ""try free pay to continue"" thing... loss of stars for failure to include that in description.Â  things I do not like: requires kindle to be sideways (my personal eh) . 2 kindle does not have a speaker, therefore a.main function of app is useless.what description should read is : if you are considering Rosetta, here's a taste. what I do like is unrelated to the app itself ...I am liking Rosetta style; instead of teaching by this word for that word, u listen with pictures. I like duolingo a lot also,Â  but there is english to read next to the Spanish ...my brain is too lazy, it defaults to my primary language. I like that I can listen and see at the same time and its almost like playing a game. I cant say that I can afford to continue right now, but I will say that this has given me a good enough idea on how rosetta works that yes, I plan to invest in it. I am not sure about also having subscription for apps, but its not a definite no. the app star rating would be higher if it was descibed more honestly and if I had a vertical hold option.Â  horizontal sucks.",,,,negative

New Lush Wallaby,4.0 out of 5 stars,Makes Learning a New Language Easy,"Rosetta Stone really does make learning a new language easy and feels quite natural.The Kindle ap is excellent for learning the sounds, understanding the spoken and written word of a new language.The only real downside I've noted deals with keeping track of plurals, special rules, feminine versus .masculine or neuter and first person, second person, third person usages.Â  These are there and they are practiced but they are not clearly explained.Â  A great deal must be inferred.Â  But then, this is the natural way our babies learn their languages as well.Â  None the less, after the first few sections, I did pick up an inexpensive grammar book to answer and clarify some of these questions.By the way, Rosetta Stone is NOT free, only the mobile interface application is free.Â  ButÂ  I did not expect Rosetta Stone to be free.Â  It's a well designed, well presented study program.Â  I wouldn't expect this level of quality to be free.",,,,negative

Justin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Will Not Work On The New Kindle Fire HDX,"Rosetta Stone is a great learning tool. I have subscribed to the online course for over a year now and my French has improved dramatically. However the Rosetta Course App is awful. Itâs only designed for Android Operating Systems and is incompatible with the OS on the new Kindle Fire HDX. The app will crash everytime the program tries to load after I sign in. I wish I would have known that prior to purchasing my new Kindle Fire, for being able to learn on the go was the primary reason I even purchased the new Kindle.Â  I contacted the Rosetta Stone Tech Department regarding this issue back in January and was in contact with someone there throughout the first 3 months of 2014. The issue was resolved in late March 2014 when there was an update on the App that made it work with the new Kindle Fire. I was able to use the app finally and was very happy. However Rosetta Stone continued to make updates to the App and now itâs back to not working. Iâm able to put in my username and password and then it will just crash on the load screen. I tried multiple times to uninstall and redownload the app to see if it will work, but it always does the same thing. I tried the App on my friends Kindle Fire HDX and again the same issue, the App wonât even load properly. This is a rip off! I tried contacting the Rosetta Stone Tech Department several times, was on the phone with them for hours, and I either got hung up on or had e-mails that were not returned for days or even weeks at a time. Considering how much Iâm paying for this each month this is downright unacceptable. Very unhappy with this app and with Rosetta Stoneâs tech department at the moment.",,,,negative

Also you can't skip them promptly either.You can turn of the spelling questions at least, which you can't do in Babbel (yet).Some of the pictures are outright confusing (although you soon learn them) - and who thought to put white speech bubbles on a white background?

AlexisCurbelo,3.0 out of 5 stars,TED App Seemingly Ungraceful With Variable Bandwidth,"I love watching TED. I used to watch it on Netflix, but I watched them all and Netflix is slow to update their list. So I began to watch it on Youtube and playback was flawless, but the user interface for YT on the Fire TV Stick is not comprehensive enough that you can't read the descriptions. Now for the TED app on Fire TV Stick: nice interface, nice playlists, horrible playback. At best, streaming stutters (freezes and plays), at worst it stops playing or locks up all together. I would have to relaunch TED app to continue watching the talks. It is aggravating not being able to watch TED talk from beginning to end without the stopping. Oh and I forgot to say that once it freezes and continues playing, the spinning circle on the middle of the screen doesn't go away. GRRRR. It is necessary to stop playback and resume (sometimes that works) but at other times I have to quit the app and relaunch. Before you say, ""your problem is your poor bandwidth"", I say that condition might be true but after trying to watch TED on the TED app, I can follow that by play several TED talks in a row on YT with no problem. I think the TED app doesn't handle fluctuating bandwidth gracefully and the developers were too quick to publish the app. The TED app needs improving.",,,,negative

Christine Murphy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Needs improvement on all platforms,"Let me start by saying that I have the iOS version, which is installed on both my iPhone and iPad.Â  It was as five-star app for a while, until iOS 7 was released.Â  I think they released one update that made it compatible with 7, but it came with an annoying bug - it makes you log in EVERY SINGLE TIME you want to access your recipe box, even though I had the ""keep me logged in"" thing checked off.Â  Very annoying.Â  I let the app developers know about this, they say they are aware of it, and it will be fixed in the next update.Â  This was months ago, I am still waiting for that update.When I saw that the Kindle Fire version was free (I paid $1.99 for the iOS version), I decided to give it a try and see if I can use it and avoid the log in issue.Â  That part worked.Â  What DOESN'T work is inside the recipe box itself.Â  When I tap on one recipe, it takes me to a completely different recipe.Â  It's not like I tapped the one next to it by mistake; it takes me to recipes that aren't even next to the one I tapped on.Â  This makes the whole recipe box feature almost useless; what is the point of having it if you can't quickly access the exact recipe you want?Â  Apps like this are supposed to make life easier, but this one in any form is more hassle than it is worth.Â  Maybe I'll try it again, if they EVER update it.Â  I'm not holding my breath waiting for that, though.Â  It's actually easier now to just go to foodnetwork.com on my device, log in there, and access my recipe box that way.",,,,negative

This spans across many devices and networks. Very disappointing. Plus you are terrified of accidentally hitting the wrong button and having to do a process all over again. The ""save your place"" function is lacking. Sometimes when I come back to the app I get back to the place I paused the video. Other times I'll maybe get to the show's splash page with my episode progress unsaved. Other times it's like the first time opening the app all over again - no saved searches and my progress is wiped out. The app has potential but is currently lacking.",,,,negative

Robert L Hill,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth Time,"When I found this app I was excited.

Same results when I opened the file for AlexandraÂ  - no obvious repeats. Then the problems began. I am unable to open the file for any other chef - the app crashes as soon as I make a selection.The good part is - all of the recipes are there; I can get to all of the recipes through the collections (TopicsÂ  and Ultimate Comfort Food), but I haven't found a way to sort the recipes in the folders making it more difficult to do more than browse the 21000 + recipes available.I have installed this app on my Kindle Fire HD and Samsung Galaxy, Soon to be removed.BTW - never found Chopped recipes, the primary reason for grabbing app!",,,,negative

Katy M,1.0 out of 5 stars,Deleted as no Paula Deen.,"Shame on you Food Network. If for no other reason, because Paula made you people a lot of money she should have been here. Her personal life doesn't change her talent nor is it a reason for you, who should have stood by her in her hour of need, to eliminate her from this app.Not only that but the case was thrown out of court as the person who sued her is white, wasn't discriminated against and had no real proof. The entire lawsuit was bogus. IMHO, an attention seeking grab by the person who sued her.Everyone makes mistakes and has to live with the consequences and I'm not saying Paula handled the whole thing well but I think she was kind of in shock and just reacted. Remember, she was agoraphobic at one time and her emotional reaction is typical of that type of disorder.Again, shame. I'll not watch Food Network again, buy any of it's merchandise or have anything to do with any chef affiliated with them. Doing what's right should never be an issue.",,,,negative

Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome App for Collecting Recipes,"SUMMARY: I have used from Thanksgiving planning through to New Year's. Wonderful! I have never found an app of any kind worth the price of a &#34;full version&#34; or subscription, but I will be subscribing to the full version of Chef Tap.PROS: First and foremost, extremely accurate on big name sites, and surprisingly accurate on smaller sites (see &#34;Testing Accuracy&#34; below). Between the clipping and recipe sizing features alone, this app is amazingly handy.There is also an easy editing feature that allows you to make it your own, as well as a notes section if you want to leave the original unsullied. I like the ability to tag and synch, but haven't played with them much.TESTING ACCURACY: I clipped 75+ recipes fromÂ  about a dozen different &#34;big name&#34; sites (Betty Crocker, BHG, Tablespoon, All Recipes, etc) and a half dozen or so from smaller blogging sites (Home-ec101, Acadian Table, etc). I double-checked both the ingredient and instructions on every single clip.Bottom line, the accuracy of the app is tied to how &#34;well-formed&#34; the source website is.Here's what I found...1. One error on a big name site - a recipe missing its last step.2. Several errors on small blogging sites - missing or duplicate ingredients or steps.2. One annoyance - several recipes that had numbered steps were missing the numbers (not the content, just the number itself). This is a step above cosmetic, because it happened almost every time, even on well-formed sites.3. A few rare, random &#34;cosmetic&#34; issues - duplicate titles, bad line breaks, or random bolding.However, all errors can be corrected with the editing mode. In addition, because the link is included in the clip, you can go back later in case you think something is missing.CONS:Together, the following cons mean I am frustrated every time I try to use the app. If it were not so accurate and useful, this would be enough to make me delete it and move on to something else:1. Takes too long to load - my devices are fast overall, with this app being noticeably longer loading on all of them.2. Loads back to it's &#34;home&#34; location instead of back to the recipe I was last looking at. By the time it opens and I remember what recipe I was going to look at, I have forgotten why.3. Synching across devices is confusing, but I suspect that is due to the limitations on the free version.",,,,negative

Cheryl,3.0 out of 5 stars,I USED to love this app,"Up until today, I rated this app as 4 or 5 stars.Â  I loved it for my Kindle Fire and started using it almost exclusively when cooking.Â  Today, however, when I went to open my recipes, it wouldn't open.Â  Instead, it showed a message saying that all my recipes were there waiting for me and I could see them just as soon as I upgraded the app!I had already decided that I didn't want to upgrade because I had seen that the upgrade changed the permissions, adding some more chancy ones that I saw no need for.Â  So now they are holding my recipes hostage unless I upgrade to the new permissions!This wouldn't be so bad if all I had in there were recipes I'd imported from the net, but there were several I'd developed myself and I really hate to lose them.Â  But I also don't like giving into blackmail.Update 11/25/12 - I've upgraded my review from 2 to 3 stars. The company was responsive to our dislike of some of the permissions and backed off a bit and I gave in and upgraded because I really like this app.Â  I love having all my recipes with me on my Kindle Fire and not having to print recipes from the net when I want to use them. NICE!I DO NOT like the ads they've added.Â  I understand they need to make money, but personally, I would rather just pay for the app than have the ads.

I downloaded about 5 recipe's and couldn't save anymore although I was using a brand new kindle fire 5th generation and only have the very basic apps like gmail on my internal device's memory. Any app that wants to be taken seriously these days needs to make sure that there apps are SD friendly if they want clients to take them seriously. I would even be willing to pay for this app if I could store all my recipe's downloads onto my card. Such a shame.,,,,negative

Erica L.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Get Rid of ""Night Mode""","Not a bad little game. Certainly more interesting then some of the other building games that you just click and wait and get pestered to spend cash on things to make the time go faster. Big plus that at least so far it has remained freeplay. My only reason for 3 stars? Night Mode. Seriously guys. I don't know whose bright idea this was, but get rid of it. You put a ""flashlight"" you move around with you finger over pieces you swap with the same movement. You guys never noticed in development that this causes you to waste your limited moves with unintended swaps because you were trying to look at the board?Â  What's even worse is when the flashlight gets stuck off screen at the bottom on full screen puzzles because you tried to look at the bottom row and you can't move it anywhere else to try and finish the puzzle and end up wasting more moves trying to swipe it back upwards.

Vampyre,3.0 out of 5 stars,Freemium Trash,This is a perfect example of 'freemium' trash. They know no one will buy their game out right so they make it 'free' so we all bite. They even give us free 'premium currency' which runs out all too fast. Then we either get pissed off at the slow pace of the game and quit (at no loss to the developers) or we break out our wallet (their dream). Wanting our money they do e everything to get us addicted and then they have it programmed. When we run low on our freebie premium currency all the quest items refuse to drop. Meaning you'll want to throw them $5 here or there just to be able to complete a collection and move on. Its disgusting. A game should either be free in entirety or pay to access.

Furthermore, after many hours of play I only have 4 locations to play 3 have maxed out until experience level is achieved.

I'm at level 29 and have spent nothing. My complaint or caution is that sometimes my moves are misread and my choice is ignored ...moves on the far side of the screen occur that I didn't choose to make. This frequently causes a loss of the level I am playing. Game updates have improved but not eliminated the problem.

Who's A Good Kiffum?,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unimpressive, Badly Designed Match 3 Games","First, let me just say that this game hounds you to spend real money more than any other game I've played. It even makes spending money a quest, which is laughable. Problem is, it's just not that good.Basically, it's just a bunch of fairly simple match 3 games wrapped up in a Egyptian era package. You play to collect food, building supplies and money to expand your town in a completely structured fashion. Your energy is very limited, an everything you do is dictated almost entirely by the game. In fact, the constant interruptions by the game are nothing short of annoying.The biggest problems I have with this game (other than it constantly asking for money and not allowing for any creativity from the player) mainly have to do with the match 3 games themselves. If you finish in fewer moves than allotted, you don't receive any materials for matches made with your leftover moves, which is stupid. Also, the new items do not fall straight down when matches have been made, which means you cannot play this game strategically. Without strategy, it's down to luck (or, more accurately, money) rather than skill, and if you fail a level because you get an unlucky board, you get nothing.All in all, it feels like a scam. Games such as this one that penalize players for their own flawed design should probably be avoided.",,,,negative

Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Small annoyances that add up to big aggravation,"Let me preface this by saying that there's a lot this game gets right.Â  Graphics are gorgeous, sound is very good, concept is intriguing, and the story is meaty without being overdone.But the aggravation in CoE is greater than the sum of its minor annoyances.First up, it's Match 3, and so there are times when you're going to be left with squares near the top of the board that can only be matched with a lucky drop.Â  By itself, it's a minor annoyance, but that's the nature of Match 3.But then, after you pass the level, there's a chance you may not even find the object you're questing for.Â  You read that right:Â  even if you DO get past a level, you may still come away empty-handed.Â  True, you'll always get SOMETHING after a completed level; but whether or not that ""something"" is of any actual value, well...An example:Â  I'm looking for one specific charger that I need to finish a main story quest.Â  I've been searching where the game sends me for TWO DAYS at this point, and that ONE little item that I need, just flat-out REFUSES.Â  TO.Â  SHOW.Â  UP.Â  Again, by itself, it's a minor annoyance; low drop rates for quest items aren't unheard of.Â  But a low drop rate for quest items on the back end, after I've already had to deal with enough of a luckfest in the upfront game, adds up the annoyance in a hurry.But the topper is that it's energy-based, and you can only make so many attempts before having enough energy to take another atttempt.Â  This one item I'm looking for, is in an area that takes 11 energy; at three minutes per energy unit, that means a 33-minute cooldown if I run out.Â  By itself, it's a minor annoyance; energy meters are almost a fact of life in high-end FTP's.Â  But when you add it to the other two...Let me put this as succinctly as I can.Â  By itself, I have no issue with losing a Match 3 level to an unlucky late-stage drop.Â  By itself, I understand quest items can be hard to find.Â  By itself, I get that energy meters are the price of FTP gaming.Where I take issue, is having to wait half an hour or more, to play the same area for the twentieth time, hoping that I don't get jobbed by an unlucky drop at the end of the level, in order to, MAYBE, find a quest item that may not even show up.Individually, those are all minor annoyances.Â  In combination, though, the whole of the aggravation is much worse than the sum of the minorly annoying parts.",,,,negative

Preston Mitchell,1.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced Blood & Guts Game that Really is Not that Unique,"OK, game developers need to eat, pay bills, and etc.Â  You can't expect their games to be truly free.Â  Thus, you really can't expect to play an online game without paying for it.Â  SO, the real question is 'how much does the game cost?'Obviously, some games are more expensive than others.Â  The best games are usually pricey.Â  BUT you should not expect an online game to be extortionate.Unfortunately, MOBILE STRIKE is the second most costly game I played on a mobile device.Â  (The Walking Dead No Man's Land is definitely the most grossly overpriced mobile game ever.)If you have more money than brains, MOBILE STRIKE is your choice.HOWEVER, other games similar to Mobile Strike are definitely more affordable....which leads to my last point.MOBILE STRIKE does have some unique features and twists...but mobile war games are as common as fleas on a dog in Spring.Â  MOBILE STRIKE is that not special.Â  It's Arnold's face that makes it stand out....which is not a reason to get sucked into a money pit.",,,,negative

MarkJaqua,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst money ever spent,"I will never play another game by Machine Zone, dba Epic War again. Once you have spent, they rapidly put new stuff out making your investment worthless, and the game gets exceedingly complicated. Don't waste your time or money.",,,,negative
Tim,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible company, often you will not get what is advertised with in-app purchases, one email per day per issue","I wish we could give negative stars. Frustrating frustrating frustrating, did I mention frustrating, zero customer service.Pros:Could be fun if it worked right and you got your money 's worthCons:1. The game never works right. Also if you think you are playing for free, forget about it, this game is not fun at all unless you spend money, otherwise you are constantly losing battles. Been there tried that, not fun at all.2. 80% of the time you don't get what you paid for. Example, you buy a pack that is $99 and comes with few different types of of upgrade, lets call them A, B and C. So you paid $99 to get upgrade A, upgrade B, Upgrade C. Fantastic you are all happy now to use the upgrade and make your moves, 1 problem, for some reason when you go to apply upgrade C, you get an error. Ok contact customer service right? Read #33. Contacting customer service = you send an email for help, you immediately get a programed response saying their team is viewing your claim, then you wait 24 to 48 hours for response. When they do respond it is always the same:A. If your issues is the game giving you an error or something not working right, then you are told ""programmers are aware and are working on it. (sure, I have been waiting for over a year for the programmers to fix my errors and nothing, meanwhile they have my money for the issue that is not working)B. If your issue is you didn't get the correct amount of something then they will keep incorrectly telling you that you are the one that is mistaken and you did get the correct amount,Â  even tho after the first 3 times you have learned your lesson and this time you have screen shots as proof.(see my first picture about credits, at the bottom you see link for 6 screnshots as proof, still didn't get my 3 millionÂ  credits till this day, now it is obsolete)4. One email per day. After waiting 24 to 48 hours (mostly 48 or longer) you get a response back fromÂ  customer service if you are lucky, and you respond, you now have to wait 24 hours for a response, in short your communication is limited to one email per day making every issue a week long project.5. Don't expect them to read your emails, example last week I like an idiot decided to come back to this game, paid for upgrade pack, part of it was something called ""instant multiple research"". What this does is allows you to upgrade bunch of categories with one click instead of literally 100s of clicks. Emailed customer service complaining about ""instant multiple research"" not working, 2 days later got a response saying we understand you have an issue with ""alliance gifts"" we are working on it. Now ""alliance gifts"" have nothing to do with ""instant multiple research"" so obviously they didn't read my email at all.That is like you call AT&T to complain about your ""cellphone service"" and they say: we understand you are having an issue with your"" tivo box"" and we are working on it.That was last week, replied to them saying their response had nothing to do with my issue, you want to know what their response is?I will let you know when they respond because 7 days and 5 emails later, I have 0 response to report to you. This is Machine Zone's idea of customer service.6. No way to contact this company other than the process above, which basically means no way of contacting this company. Mobile Strike, gods of War and a couple of other games are owned by machine zone.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME / COMPANY, THEIR FINE PRINT SAYS YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HAVE THE GAME WORKING PROPERLY OR OWE YOU ANYTHING AT ALL WHETHER ITS THE GAME WORKINGÂ  CORRECTLY, YOU GETTING WHAT YOU PAID FOR IN-APP PURCHASES.

Briggette Blalock,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't get it you will waste storage for nothing.,Although the graphics are great for a kindle fire and the game gets updated almost every day is great but every thing else is bad here are a few reasons why.1. The game get boring after a while.2. There is no animations of your units fighting the enemy which turns down your excitement of taking down an enemy.3. This game is so terrible that almost all the bases around you are abandoned YES I said it there are a lot of abandoned bases which obviously mean that the game is bad.4. Some of the guilds in this game are not even active anymore I went In to a guild and I wasn't for a month and I came back and the boss didn't kick me out so I mail him to say hi and he didn't respond which means it's completely abandoned.5. Yes there are bullies in this game so watch out for them.Should you get the game? Absolutely noHere are my reasons why this game is bad I mean shoot even Invasion: New frontier is better even though the developers stop updating it. And obviously the game is just a rip off of Game of War don't get the game it's just not fun. I rate 2 stars for graphics and updates.,,,,negative

Ignacio,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not fun unless you keep spending,"The game keeps pushing upgrades and boosts on you every minute you play.

kim,4.0 out of 5 stars,fun but to many dead bases and states...,very fun game but could use some cleaning up with in the states the low states should be merged with the middle and high states.the low states seem to attract vulgar mean and bullying type people.i think you should be allowed to move your base at least once if your base is over level 5 if you find you don't like the state your in.Â  mainly the low states.the low states has a whole lot of inactive alliances maybe 3 to 5 alliances might be active more like 3.i almost have a base in every state just so i know whats going on and it seems to need a look out person anyway. and in case i'm asked for a opinion...i think once a year the game should be shut down and dead bases should be cleaned up there is to many dead bases no one plays any more ether they left the game or started all over again with another base in another state but there is way to many dead bases in each state... i think there should be a way to remove a dead base similar to the rebels who ever attacks it and gathers from it keeps all the base had accumulated if the person returns after a year lets say then they have to build a new base that should be the penalty for leaving a base and most likely that won't happen most the time the password is forgotten anyway....other then it needs cleaning up it is a fun game to play.i would recommend...,,,,negative

The standard reply includes a request for you to do a hard reset and reload of the game to restore operations.So in the middle of the war game, while vulnerable and attacking, the game will stop, and you are expected to perform a technical process that lasts 5 min or more on your phone. The net result is you have become cannon fodder for an attacking player, and you just lost the money you spent.Also, there are frequent system resets required, both because of the constant marketing updates inserted in game play, and for fixes and adjustments.

To add insult to injury before the unlocks you need resources millions and billions to build research or train soldiers you need resources just to have the soldiers but it takes a week to 59 days to get 1million resource off a tile . Unless again you pay 99.99 to buy them but it's only enough got about a week never worth it..... If you wait a year they may give you the other stuff free but they will come out with something new that you can only get for a small fee of 99.99... There are lots of display errors and glitches which they won't give unless a bunch of people complain.Â  They won't give you a refund most of there answers to your problems are computer generated and they will hey rude if u keep replying to your email ...

The game is laggy, crashes all the time both on Android and IOS. The servers they use have no way to keep up with even slightly above normal activity. The games creator, Epic War LLC is currently tied up in legal battles and this game is simply a money grab in an attempt to pay for the court costs and pad their pockets and give them a parachute for once they inevitably have to pay out a settlement.

Items used go fast, when the servers are having problems you are apt to lose many of these cash items and game won items. If the app crashes and you lose items or army or anything else for that matter, the developers give you a such minute portion of what you need to rebuild and their attempts to rectify any problems with the game are then turned on you and your internet speed or your device.

It is really ridiculous right now and has been for more than a few months. Upgrades and game changes come at a relentless pace. Gear and other items quickly become obsolete and the guys that are big spenders or find ways to load their own packs soon overpower anything you have. it becomes a case of you chasing your own tail. Not to mention some serious flaws in the algorithms which now heavily favor the attackers. There was a time you could set up a pretty good defense base with top level troops. Now they drop like flies and are extremely expensive if you want to replace them. It is obvious the developers have done this on purpose to drive up sales. Well, guess what guys, many are fed up with current events and quitting daily. Additionally, since so many players are leaving, all you find is dead bases everywhere and things are now boring as hell. Epic War outpaced themselves on this one in the name of money.

One day your base is upto date and literally next day it is out of date. Other thing is you try to tell their support staff of problems you get some automated response from them that is crap and really do address issues for their customers. Really sad I have invested lot money in this game and basically they turned a good game into a piece of crap. Anyone looking a playing game do not even consider downloading it.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Written to save you from a big mistake.,"Don't waste your time or money. If you aren't prepared to spend, literally, thousands of dollars, don't bother. You won't be competitive and you will basically be playing FarmVille to get minuscule amounts of what you need for growth. Bigger players will bully you by attacking and destroying your base regularly. Even a middle of the road spender is a non factor. If you aren't going to spend AT LEAST $300 PER WEEK don't get this game.The things you buy with money are absolute in 4-8 weeks. They fluff the purchase packs with obsolete items to make it look like a huge deal. They release new things every week. Sometimes $100 will get it for you sometimes it's up to 7 $100 purchases and everything you got is trash in a matter of weeks because they release something newer and better.Most players are bullied out of the game in the first month. 3 to 4 months in it's nothing but big and medium spenders with no targets to hitÂ  because the little guys all quit and the medium guys all stay shielded from all of the big players who all split off into alliances for big spenders only.Customer service is terrible. Complaints fall on deaf ears. You get generic computer generated broad topic responses. The response has a link to continue to push your issue but you only get another generic computer generated response. EW games and the Mobile Strike team have made a game that will soak up your money and become stale in about 3 months time and won't give you the time of day if you voice your concerns or bring your issue to them to be resolved.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF WASTING YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE",,,,negative

trapeze,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Game of War Clone...The Total Turdfest That Is ""Mobile Strike""...Do Not Download or Play!","I wrote a review many months ago about Game of War: Fire AgeThat review has become the highest rated (most helpful) review for GoW and that is because I stripped away the BS and told the complete truth about it. I could write the exact same review for Mobile Suck. Why? Well...here are the reasons:1. Mobile Suck is the exact same game as Game of War. There are zero differences other than purely cosmetic ones. The game play is the same. The psychological ploys to separate you from literally thousands of dollars are the same. Everything is the same.2. Mobile Strike is produced by the same pack of sadistic con artists and child molesters as Game of War. Yes, it's true. Epic War LLC is a subsidiary of Machine Zone. Feel free to look them up and you will see that they are both listed with the same street address (555 Hamilton Ave) in Palo Alto, CA.Mobile Suck is an exact copy of Game of War. It is designed to deceive you and to con you out of a ridiculous amount of money. Just like Game of War.There is no point in me writing another review for this over ripe turd of a game. Just go to the Game of War page and read my review. I will, however, issue you the following general warning:1. Do not download and play this game unless you are very wealthy and/or very gullible. This game is all about the destruction of money. Your money and your competitors money. This is a pay-to-win game. You CANNOT be competitive in this game without spending hundreds of dollars per month. Many, many hundreds of dollars. Some of your competitors will be so wealthy and so stupid that they will spend thousands of dollars per month so that they can crush you and destroy the money you have spent. At its most basic root, Mobile Suck (and Game of Spending) are only about the destruction of money...your money and your competitors' money. You will be conned, coerced and manipulated into spending so that you can ""win"" but you won't win. You will only lose a staggering amount of your money and you will have ZIP to show for it.2. Do not download and play this game if you wish to have a life. This game will destroy all of your free time. You will spend every waking moment working in and on this game. You will sacrifice time to play this game that would otherwise be spent in the real world with your family and friends doing things that are of actual value.3. Never, ever allow a child to play this game. That would be child abuse. I am totally sincere about this. Keep children away from this monstrosity. If you are foolish enough to allow a child to play it then make damn good and sure that the kid cannot get a hold of your credit card or iTunes account. But don't let a child play this game.So there you have it. Mobile Suck is Game of Spending, the absolute worst game ever offered on Amazon or anywhere else.

I've tried this game on many different devices and PC with same results. Many errors and by bugs still in game. Spend that kind of money, and your game crashes or lags, you can lose everything! Technical support is as good as asking your cat for help. You are wasting your time and money on this one! Overall horrible. Needs to be improved before I play anymore and waste more money and time. This game is not truely about skill, but more about the money. They should refund everyone's money that loses everything due to game errors. Graphics are ok, but nothing like commercial. Rather lame durring the war part of the game. I've played this game since day one, and have a lot of regret, due to crashes, lagging and bugs still in game.

If you have thousands to spend on a game that offers nothing for your investment then, be my guest, but don't think you can get over by trying to play without spending thousands of dollars. Imho, it takes at least one pack per level up of your base. The game offers challenges, but the pay outs are even weaker than the gold packs. The amount of rss and gold u spend to reach a goal are100x more than the payouts. If the packs were 5 bucks each it might be doable. $100 a day won't get you to the top at their current price.",,,,negative

dave ault,1.0 out of 5 stars,Walk away Fast,There is no strategic defense against a player who has been playing before you and has built up power. You will be continually attacked for your resources and have to spend time or real money building back up - a vicious circle of a time waster. And it is making some of these more powerful players wealthy selling what resources they take from the weaker and selling them back to you and others on outside pirate sites.The only defense is to use gold to buy 24/7 shields to protect your base and spend real money for more gold when you run out. And when you are collecting resources you will have to watch your collecting troops non stop...take your eye off them for a second and you will loose them all to attack and then take you weeks if not months to build your troops back up. Not designed for people that have a job or a real life.,,,,negative

Matthew Wimberley,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mobile Strike App is just a money pit scam,"Terrible development. Unless you can afford to spend hundreds to thousands a month on in game purchases, don't bother. They release some new pack every few days to few weeks, and the $99.99 packs are the only ones even worth buying because the others won't even keep you competitive with anyone else in the game. The other problem is the glitchiness, lag and sever errors due to the massive load on the game. I have had several problems with the game. I've spent close to $700 on I app purchases already, and the programmers say of fixing the issue is by throwing a few perks your way that don't even come close to making up for what their server lag and app crashes cost you. They even had an issue where items in some of their premium packs weren't showing up in your in game inventory when you bought them, and they weren't telling anyone even though they were aware of the issue. They customer support team even admitted this in an email correspondence with me when I confronted them about missing items.",,,,negative
Alex B.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Game of cash and zero skills!,"This game is literally a carbon copy of Game of War, everything about it is the same. They just changed the theme and that's it.Â  So just like GoW it's simply a TRAP to make money. It has terrible graphics (nothing like the Ads) and needs very little skills and TONS of cash! It's also super frustrating when you start as people with thousand times stronger armies simply burn and kill your bases over and over, which is an ingenious way to make you PAY so you could defend yourself and try to grow.Literally everything is about selling you gold! EVERYTIME you start the game, or even open a notification they POP-up an Ad to buy gold, over and over and over again. It's ridiculously annoying. Feels like a porn site with pop-up ads. Then, when you decide to buy a pack, it gets interesting. Your first purchase is $5, your second $25, then goes to a $100 and more! And they're all the same! So the same pack that cost you $5 earlier in the game will cost you $150 later on! Exactly the same thing. So basically they're raising the price on the customers who spend money again and again.The strategy part simply doesn't come into play until you are level 21 or above. Until then, it's just a matter of who loses patience and who shells out the cash to get to HQ21. Then you can have battles with your alliance and start strategizing. It takes you easily 45-60 days to get there if you spend less than $100 and even with more spending it takes a month or so.Overall, the game could have been amazing if it wasn't for all the annoying ads and price increasing gold packs, and if it had better structure to help smaller players. Graphics could also be improved, like the fake ads they made.Overall, do NOT let your kids play this game, nor should you. UNLESS you're willing to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!PS. It's a lot cheaper to buy someone's account online than to start from scratch.",,,,negative
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Before January 2017 this game was fun and fairly expensive,"Before January 2017 this game was fun and fairly expensive. Now it's just a cash cow. In total I have spent 13,450.00 and I'm now way behind everyone else. They add new things every 3/4 days now and if you don't have it you're too weak to compete. All of this is bad enough but now they've begone literally stealing players money. I bought a 100.00 pack and 5 minutes later got charged a second 100.00 dollars. They refuse to return my money or give the pack I paid for saying they have no record of the purchase. I know 30 people who have had the same thing happen to them. So I decided to play with just gift cards but I ran into the new con where they take the money but don't give you the pack. They swear the items are in my account only they aren't. I've sent 6 Screenshots showing this but they just keep lying and swearing it's there. To make things even worse I began getting attacked last night and the game kicked me out. I tried over and over to get back in only to get a server busy error. I had to uninstall then reinstall to get back in. When I did I found out the game switched my gear so I was weaker and that I had lost over half of my billions of troops. Do not be fooled this game is now crap and not worth playing.",,,,negative

"" Company based in Cali as a LLC "" RESIDES ON THE THIRD FLOOR"" to comply to U.S Laws but that is not the parent company.Each state does have a bully but over all its not a bad game. Once you become 60 Mill power many of the super powers do not dare to hit you because they ill loose. They will have to rally you with many people. The rallies can take 5 minutes to deploy which gives you enough time to shield. Which kind of sucks because if you really want to destroy a bully you can. It makes it real hard to defeat a bully. They don't even allow speed ups on the rally which is another terrible thing but you can speed up regular attacks.The game is good but it does lack features.

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Dollars and Time Dissappears into the Mobile Strike Ruleless Black Hole,"Mobile Strike, if you have thousands of dollars to spend to become like the power players, well, then you will be just fine.Â  The problem is to make your base grow you must continually spend to buy items needed to grow your base.Â  This is not altogether bad; it becomes an issue when you sit under the peace shield 24 hours each day.Â  Each state has a head of state who makes the rules and changes them at whim or whenever they are in a bad mood.Â  These players can have over 1 billion in power and you can't even scratch them.Â  For example I have a Level 21 base with 90 million power, today was nap which is a no attack period until midnight.Â  The leader of the state decided to change the rules today and gave 1 hours notice and believe me, this was a lot of notice for him.Â  On the drive home from work my peace shield expired even though I don't need it during nap I have learned to use it.Â  I sat in traffic and when I got home to check my shield figuring I had until midnight but would initialize it early, the head of state had already gone out and burned all unshielded bases.Â  Destroyed 125k traps, 185k troops and took my commander.Â  It will cost a lot to rebuild the traps and time as well.Â  I don't mind the time element here; however, I do mind that a guy with his daddy's credit card can buy so much power that it is virtually impossible to have any fair game play.Â  Several players gave up and joined his alliance, the old if you can't beat them join them.Â  But, when this leader is on state chat the way he speaks and treats people is worse than Donald Trump crossed with Hitler.Â  As if everything negative in the world is channeled through him and into the game aimed at everyone playing in the game.Â  What would help, the game makers making rules which all must go by including those who are head of state.Â  In this way, at least no attack times are predictable and stable.Â  Otherwise, you must be logged into the game constantly to see what the latest rules are.Â  Also, there are so many alliances who are allies of the head of state there is no one left to actually fight them.Â  Tonight's quick rule change and attack our our alliance made at least 6 players discuss quitting and 3 have quit in the past week.Â  Our alliance has 2 billion in power, this is disgustingly inadequate to do anything.Â  The head of state alone is 20 billion in power.Â  Have fun wasting your time and money.",,,,negative

Dirk,1.0 out of 5 stars,Will you be a wallet warrior?,"mKvVAt first, this game can be quite fun; however, you will quickly realize that the game is controlled by players that have spent $10000 and more which are virtually unstoppable due to the game mechanics. These high players go around attacking relatively new players for their RSS/resources and sooner or later you will be on that list. Not to mention, the game developers are always releasing upgrades which you can only get by spending some cash.You have 2 choices when playing this game:1. Constantly open your wallet to buy $100 packages. And even if you decide that, there will be someone else that will spend more making your investment worthless.2. Not spend any money but instead be constantly attacked for your hard earned resources.I have spent quite a bit in this game and it has been one of the biggest let downs ever. If I were you, I would not spend a dime for this game or you will come to regret it.",,,,negative

Michael H.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Grossly unbalanced game looking for your money,"This game relentlessly asks you to buy various packages from 4.99 up. The game is grossly unbalanced, with extremely powerful players attacking newcomers in lopsided battles.Â  The stronger player may be close to a million times stronger than the victim.Â  Regular kill events are structured so that any weak players are counted against the stronger players in the sector.Â  This leads to stronger players actively attacking weaker ones so that they quit.Â  Approximately 90% of new players quit within a few days.Â  The game consists of poking buttons to initiate research, building, troop construction, or manufacture, then waiting for the process to complete.Â  It is possible to have expeditions leave base for supplies, but they are vulnerable to attack.Â  In game purchases are not required per we, but it may not be possible to advance rapidly or compete at a reasonable level without the purchases.",,,,negative

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Game. People stop hating.,"If you think that they are stealing your money, think again. The players buy the packs, and it is on the players, not the game.If you think of this game being a complete copy of Game of War, think about the word Inspiration.If you hate how there are too many players that are more powerful than you, well, you should have joined earlier and you should have bought more packs at the same time too.Again with the money,Â  if you think they are still stealing your money by raising the prices, think again. They have better stuff, but they DO make a mistake by removing the cheaper packs after buying packs because some people spend 10$ to buy two 5$ packs, but can only buy one, which gives both the game and the player a loss.Overall, I think a 4/5 is reasonable. It is not perfect, but it is more than just decent. So (as of today) giving this game an average of 3/5 is terrible because there are many haters that hate over even the slightest thing imaginable and noticeable. That lowers the rating for good games. The slightest things...people are messed up sometimes.",,,,negative

Also is not cheap to buy packs, a decent pack to get your power raised to a decent level cost around Â£80-100+. Now many players in this game are over 1 trillion power.

Also, its constantly telling you to do recommended missions with a big hand pointing to the mission button which is really annoying.

Dina,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Want To Believe,"This thing works.I know because I was sitting out on the front deck with it running and my roommate was with me, reading and pretty much ignoring me.(He's a die-hard skeptic.)So I asked it if anyone wanted to communicate and my roommate, annoyed, told me that ""ghosts don't exist"".Five minutes of silence and then, out of nowhere, it said, ""Robert"".My roommate stared at me.That's his name.",,,,negative

(I had downloaded this app one week prior) I started the app and started asking questions most people would ask a ghost. Who are you? Is there anyone here? I had a camera set up to film everything. I set down my kindle fire to check the video then I hear the word ""college"". I'm a college student. I brushed it off and kept checking the camera then it says ""surrounded"" and I get a chill down my spine. I went to check it and the screen showed 4 bright red signatures. Now THAT got my attention. I went back to the camera (this time with the kindle to watch the signals) and kept doing what I was doing. Occasionally, I would look at the screen the check those signals. They were still there. They had not moved. I could feel eyes on me. Watching me. I hear ""blood"" come on the app. At that point, I realized it was time to go. Coincidence? Maybe.

My cousin said, &#34;What is your name?&#34; And it said 'Joe' and then a huge yellow dot appeared in front of us, and the top said 'Shimmering' It scared me really badly, and I deleted the app instantly.

Crescent,3.0 out of 5 stars,Its more psychological....,"Well, I wouldn't consider this a fake ....but the likely possibility is that they just have random dots appearing and design it like a real ghost radar and have random common words appearing. I just downloaded it and when I opened my app, it was like ""pot "" and on the right side of me there was a flower pot. I thought it was cool, but come on, there are pots everywhere! either in your yard or somewhere else, you can always find something common with the random word that appears on the radar. Its a cool app, but in my opinion, they just choose a buncha random words that make you think this app can ""detect "" stuff when your fooling yourself out. I was using it this morning on my bed and it was like ""can, winter, principal ""?! Wtf, am I in school or something? lol but this app is worth the download even though it might be fake.",,,,negative

AO Irish Girl,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fun but FAKE!! And very simple.,"I got this app for 2 reasons: it was free, and it looked cool. But it got annoying. All it was, really, was a green radar that showed little dots every so often. I quickly got bored with it and deleted it. Afterwards, I was persuaded to actually BUYING the other version of Ghost Radar, which was supposedly ""better."" Sure, it was a little cooler. You could go back and forth from the classic radar and an activity waves line graph. It also ""translated the ghosts messages to you,"" which I actually believed for a while. But don't believe a word of it, people. The radar does not ""sense"" anything. If you want an app that you can just use for fun, go ahead. But it does NOT sense ghosts.

Ellie,5.0 out of 5 stars,very intimidating.,"This app seems to work very nice. Ghosts are in my house all the time-consuming I see, hear, and feel them. We had a Ouija board out and this app on and we got words that we didn't expect. We came to find that I have a three year old girl named Elizabeth, a boy which remains U.N. named, and an adult named Corey, aged 22. This app works, because right after my friend left I was alone in the house- I thought. I felt a freezing cold thin layer on my back, and the back of my arms, as if I was being protected out something. I heard a crash outside, and the feeling went away. Turns out, some kids were trying to scare me, but I had no idea who they were even! They walked away when they found out I had a knife, so I haven't seen them again. But it's weird, because they were dressed in old clothes; they were pale, and looked tired or sick. I'll never know! Just be careful, you never know what you're summoning...",,,,negative

LoboWolf,5.0 out of 5 stars,Animals or people spirits,"I got this game a few weeks after I saw the Conjuring. I didn't believe that spirit stuff could be THAT crazy or dramatic.

I'm not sure if I'm going then myself or there is some sort of spirit who likes or hates me. I've watched Celebrity Ghost Stories in the past but I stopped when I entered 5th grade two years ago. Now, as a seventh grader, I'm not interested in this stuff anymore. I got this app to see how fake it was. Our parents were asleep so we (my sister and I) thought that was close to""alone"" so I turned this on. We have had many pets before. They all died except one that I set free. When I started my homework, I saw a blue dot kind of behind-ish and right-ish. I looked at where you see communication and it said. I said hi and how are you. I said if you want me to turn it off to not die yourself. Nothing appeared so I kept my saying and came into here. This is a great app.Ooh! Just now I realized a dog died next door.

I believe in ghosts because I've actually had experience with them before, but there's no way that my house would have three ghosts all at once and then disappear when I tap the screen. It's just like ""Okay, spirits, I'm your overlord now because I have an app that lets me ""stalk"" you guys!"" :D but no: Ghosts can do basically what they want and go where they want.

carrie s daly,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work as a means of mirroring an iOS device to a FireStick,"March 3, 2020I was looking for an app that would allow me to display photos/home videos etc. from my iPhone & iPad to a non-smartTV via my Amazon FireStick.Â  This app supposedly does that using the Apple AirPlay protocol built in to the newest Apple mobile devices.Â  I downloaded the AirScreen app onto the FireStick from the Amazon website and installed it on the FireStick according to the instructions.Â  According to the pre-loaded tutorial video bundled with the app, I should then have been able to go to any iOS mobile device with AirPlay enabled and from the ControlCenter, scan for other Airplay compatible device connected to the same WiFi network (which the FireStick was) and select that device and begin mirroring.Â  Unfortunately the app was unable to detect either my iPhone or my iPad although both had AirPlay enabled and both were connected to the same WiFi network.I then called Amazon Tech Support and spent about an hour on the line with them while they logged in to remotely view my FireStick screen and operate it remotely.Â  The were unable to solve the issue so the called Apple Support, making it a 3-Way conference call.Â  The Apple support rep remotely logged on to my iPad and operated it remotely.Â  Again, no one was able to make the iPad connect with the FireStick.Â  Since I had already tried and had the same problem with an AirPLay enabled iPhone also, it seemed unlikely to me and to the Apple rep that both iOS devices were malfunctioning but rather that it was either the FireStick and/or the app itself that was the problem.Â  The Apple rep came to the same conclusion, so she departed from the conference call.The Amazon rep remained on the line and we did some further checks to determine if there were any other problems with the FireStick itself, which there were not.Â  Every other non-AirScreen related function of the FireStick appeared to be working normally so we all concluded that there must be a problem with the app itself.I had downloaded the free/demo version of the app, which claims to function fully without upgrading to the paid version, but with advertising pop-ups.Â  I was not going to pay to upgrade until i saw the app work as advertised, which had it done so, I would then have paid to upgrade to the ad-free version.Â  Accordingly I do not know if the upgraded version would have worked properly or not.In short, this app does not do what it claims to do and therefore should be considered useless for the purpose of mirroring an iOS device to a FireTV device.",,,,negative

Judebert,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unreliable, distressing, use better alternatives","Recommendation: Use AirReceiver insteadPicture is acceptable, but delayed by several seconds. Keeps warning me that my network is slow. Disconnects after 15 minutes or so to show an ad, requiring a reconnect from the projecting computer and occasionally restarting the app. Ad display is unreliable, in which case it asks you to purchase *a subscription* and waits for 15 seconds.The ad tries to guilt you into a purchase by claiming expensive server requirements. But Miracast is a Wi-Fi Direct connection, and AirPlay and Google Cast go straight to the display... so the servers are either collecting your data or serving ads. Either way it's a ridiculous cost.Â  (Possibly they're saving the ""recordings""? I don't want that.)We used AirReceiver and Chrome Cast's ""desktop"" source. It worked with much less delay, smoother video, no ads, no ""slow network"" warning, and stayed connected for hours with no issues. AirReceiver was satisfying; AirScreen experience was user-hostile and distressing.Uninstalling ASAP.",,,,negative

And you either have to use one big block for the outside walls and draw the individual lines inside, or place several blocks next to each other for rooms, you cannot drag and drop a room inside an existing block. This makes it difficult to determine overall dimensions. Lastly, the icon available for closets is the same as the more commonly known symbol for showers. I'm not sure what that is all about.

So i can hear my pup howling and crying but am helpless to calm him down.Â  Also, the camera randomly begins scanning the room and it takes time to get it focused back on my pup.Â  In this technologically rich culture, it is a shame this is so difficult to figure out and use.Â  I don't recommend this product.",,,,negative

Jonathan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing is free,"This is less a problem with the app, which works fine, and more a complaint about CBS. You can't stream anything through the app for free.

UpDoppler,2.0 out of 5 stars,Streaming the Super Bowl was at best bad,"Streaming the Super Bowl was at best bad, consistently buffering throughout the game, FPS dropping to nothing but pix elated blobs and unidentifiable objects.

The audio was multiple seconds behind the video which made it difficult because entire sentences where spoke before I actually heard them.Â  I thought maybe if I restart that would clear it up. Sadly no. The app was bad enough I just went ahead and used my over the air antenna instead. I wanted this app to work well. But it did not. I cannot recommend it at this time as a result.

Reviews All Day Long,1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst of the worst TV apps for me.,"Shows me the schedule, but will not play any video. It does not even show signed of loading or trying. I press and I press and nothing. I gave up and just decided it was easier to watch highlights on ESPN than try to get this app to work. Not sure why 99% of TV apps are garbage, but maybe it's because these companies are unable to understand that people don't watch live television during primetime hours anymore. Maybe one day they will realize it's not 1950. This is a main critique on my iPhone. Using my firestick, there's no live sports options at all. I'm only showing highlights and schedule.",,,,negative
Sean Ellis,1.0 out of 5 stars,Completely useless on FireTV devices,"This is two different apps depending on the device, so pay attention to the app description above to see if you'll be one of the 5 star or the 1 star folks. On phones and tablets it is a full featured app with live streaming and things like bracket challenges. On the Fire TV devices it's a horribly useless app where you can only stream seemingly random clips from different shows, but no live streaming. This makes one of the most useful use cases (streaming the live game that is being preempted by a game running late) for TV devices a no-go. It's not like this is a premium paid channel, so blocking from streaming while freely broadcasting makes literally no sense.",,,,negative

spider63,1.0 out of 5 stars,Never Works & All About Gambling,"This is the worst streaming channel I have ever used. It usually plays for about a minute, then freezes up and kicks you out. When it actually works, there seems to be only one host, a Greek guy who just gives gambling information as to every game, and the book-makers are the main guests. This is the sleaziest garbage sports network I have ever seen. A waste of money on every level, and a major disappointment from CBS.",,,,negative
akirk1103,1.0 out of 5 stars,App,Pointless if I can't actually watch a game anywhere in any cb s app. This is only one of many reasons why you should leave sports up to espn.

The absolute worst part is the replay feature, though, which I'd imagine is the reason most people purchase it in the first place. You can only fast forward 10 seconds at a time. That means that If you only want to see the third period, the 4th quarter, or the last three innings, you have to click that button around 700 times to get there. 700 times!!!! Once you get to where you want to start, pray the app doesn't decide to just shut down and kick you back to the fire stick home screen (which it does ALL THE TIME). Because, guess what? It doesn't remember where you stopped! Looks like you've got 700 more clicks in your future. C'mon, Fox. This is the 21st Century and this app is a POS.",,,,negative

Matt Wolfgang,1.0 out of 5 stars,This app made me hate using my FireTV Stick!,"Massively frustrating! The screenshot in the Amazon App Store should be a gif of turquoise circle spinning!

After it freezes, I'll hit the back button, select the game I want to watch again, it will play for 30 seconds and BAM - spinning turquoise circle! Sometimes, if you wait for a minute or two, it will eventually start playing again for another 30 seconds, and then freezes again.In my experience, this is the WORST streaming app from any cable channel or broadcast network. I have such a negative attitude towards this app that it's bled over to my feelings about my FireTV Stick. Since the NBA season started this year, I've been using my FireTV Stick less and less and using my Roku more. Now, I almost never use my FireTV Stick. The only time try to use it when I try to watch the Mavericks play.Â  I noticed that I was using the Roku almost exclusively a while back, but I couldn't really figure out why. Outside of FSGO, I was using mostly the same apps on both devices.

Trillium,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too expensive and cumbersome.,"We go fubo for watching European soccer, and it's not worth it.Too expensive. At $45, you might as well get cable with DVD. That's a little more, but you have a lot more options.Too cumbersome. You have to record ahead of time. No on-demand. If you want to watch, e.g. ""La Liga"", you never know what game is going to show at a certain time.While living in Europe, we had dazn for sports streaming. That was less than half the price, everything was on demand (meaning you don't need to plan ahead and record) and you knew exactly which game was showing when. Too bad dazn isn't available here.",,,,negative
Nathaniel,2.0 out of 5 stars,All the Sports - Time Blocks May End Your Viewing,"Absolutely every sport you can imagine is on Fubo. No exceptions. Even the most obscure sports were available. Ultimately, we discontinued use of FuboTV for one reason. Each game or event has a specific amount of time. Until the program starts, you can't select it. When the time ends, REGARDLESS of whether your sporting event is finished, the stream stops. Period. No saved recording, no continued watching, it's just done.We switched to YouTubeTV and found we had none of the same issues. Sport options are severely diminished, but if you're looking for something that will stream all major football games, YouTubeTV is the way to go.If you're into Soccer/Cycling/F1 Racing/etc, Fubo is way better for you, but may result in missing the last parts of a game.",,,,negative

P. Rey,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite ready for primetime,"I'm currently in the FuboTV seven day trial. Thus far, I've found a few bugs in the Fire TV app. (At least, if you're using the Fire TV Game Controller.) Pause, fast forward and reverse do not work. On the game controller, pressing the ""A"" button pauses Amazon, Sling, DirecTV Now and Playstation Vue playback. It does not, however, work with Fubo. Additionally, if you exit playback mid-program, there is no ""resume"" feature. Conversely, playback on a PC has no problems whatsoever. I just much prefer watching TV on an actual TV. (And yeah, I know, I can ""cast"" from my computer.)DVR recordings are limited to only 10. That's something I can live with because I'm only recording motorcycle racing on Bein Sports. That said, if I was using Fubo as my primary streaming service, that would be a deal breaker.As for image/video quality, there are no issues. It's on par with all of the other streaming services (aside from Amazon with their AMAZING UHD 4K playback.)I suspect FuboTV will fix their Fire TV app quickly, so I'll probably try them again in a few months. They are definitely on the right track, but the Fire TV app is certainly in its infancy.",,,,negative
Joseph Jackson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Flasely Advertised the Eagles vs Cowboys Game,"It was advertised on Google search engine that the Eagles vs Cowboys game could be viewed on FuboTV. After signing up for the free trial, logged into the website and could not find the games broadcast on a search on the FuboTV website. I immediately cancelled the free trial subscription and after cancelling, I still continue to get emails about their services and links to reactivate the service. I have emailed them to confirm my cancellation (no response) and requested that no further contacted is needed because I do not deal with any company that advertises one thing and does not provide the actual solicited service. If the game that I was looking to view was blacked out or not available, it should have been indicated in the advertisement. I signed up and provided my credit card for services that were not provided. FuboTV completely wasted my time and after I cancelled the service, I am still receiving emails stating: Your trial is still activeIf you're no longer interested in watching fuboTV and you'd like to end your trial early, visit 'My Account Page' and click 'Cancel Subscription' and follow the steps to cancel.

Danni,1.0 out of 5 stars,Glitchy,"We do not like this app and will be cancelling. It does fine for live tv but if you try to watch a series it is horrible. When you pay as much as you do for this app and then they force you to watch 7 commercials every 5 minutes it gets old really fast. You cannot pause it during a commercial break either so if you have to leave the room you will feel like a kid again when you have to hightail it back in to watch.Â  If you pause the episode you are watching it will error out and then 9 times out of 10 you have to restart from the beginning. It will not let you pick up where you left off.Â  Forget trying to ff or rewind. It doesn't work. Also, if you are watching a series and you pick an episode you have already seen when you try to go back it exits out of the app instead of just the episode so you have to find your way all the back through.

CSX,2.0 out of 5 stars,"terrible user interface, unreliable streaming, slow to connect, lower res ""HD""","Boy do I regret believing the reviews on Fubo.Â  Yes, they have some sports coverage that's hard to get elsewhere.Â  But it's not worth it.Firstly the user interface is really really bad.Â  Who designed this thing?Â  It's clunky, allows very little customization, gives limited information about shows, makes it difficult to change channels, etc. etc.Then you find that it takes some time after you switch to a new channel to get a non-blurry picture.Â  What?Â  Are you running this out of your basement, Fubo?And every so often there's an outage.Â  Unexplained and usually unreported, but there you go, you can't get that stream now.Â  Has happened to me more than once, and usually right when there was a ""I don't want to miss this"" event.Â  I've stopped keeping track.Finally, all the so-called HD streams are really at 720p, not 1080p.Â  There's one ""experimental"" 4K channel, rarely has anything on it.Yeah, I've already cancelled my service, just waiting for the current sub to drain.Â  (Yes, drain is the right term.)Â  I'm considering Hulu -- it has most of the channels I want, and works well with Fire boxes. I'll miss the occasional La Liga and Ligue 1 and Serie A matches I was able to catch, but I can't justify Fubo for access to the few games I have time to watch.",,,,negative
Angel,1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk doesn't work and bilks you after you cancel,"This has to be the crappiest app I have ever downloaded for streaming.

Mr. Doh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't bother if you have Amazon Fire TV,"Amazon Fire TV implementation is terrible. No entry for ""Settings"" at the top. The navigation between features is much less useful than any other alternative internet TV offering that I've seen. Like when you press the menu button on Playstation Vue, you see the current show, the next couple of shows, and can switch to the Guide if you want. On Fubo, you press the menu button and you can change the video resolution, worthless. They really need to work on navigation for users with Fire TV. About the only thing that you get for live TV are select, the arrow buttons, and return. I assume the Roku is much better, not going to pay $100 to find out, though. The only plus is that the local stations seem to work well. Not the stuttering that I see on Playstation Vue local channel, or all the myriad of problems with the local stations on Hulu with Live TV. But the navigation with Fire TV is so bad, I can't use it.What I'd really like to do is rearrange the guide to put all the sports channels together at the bottom of the guide, instead of having some at the top, and another group at the bottom. Really wacky the way that the channels are arranged. Some are alphabetical like you'd like (the non-sports ones), and the sports channels are just disorganized.But in the end it doesn't matter. Unless I can find another way to use this app without the Fire TV, ain't going to happen.",,,,negative
David A,4.0 out of 5 stars,Some Problems But No Show Stoppers,"I must say from the start that the only reason I purchased this app for to watch the Giro d'Italia (Italy's version of the Tour de France). I use NBC Sports Gold to watch cycling but the Giro was not a covered race. A quick Google search led me to fubotv. I primarily watch TV through FireTV so I downloaded the fubotv app and then subscribed through my computer. I have been using fubotv for less than a week. Based upon that experience I offer the following observations.I am able to watch the Giro as I desired. There are quite a few other channels available but I have not watch any, for reasons to be discussed below. The picture quality is fine and as with all internet apps it is dependent on you internet speed/quality.My biggest disappointment is the limited capacity of the ""DVR"" feature. While it is true you can ""record"" shows for later viewing you are limited to three ""recording"" total. Also, you must watch those recording within 72 hours of there recording, after which they will be deleted. This limitation has prevented me from recording any thing other than the Giro (which is a 21 day race) which explains why I have on experience with other channels. This wouldn't be too bad except the DVR does not provide the ability to record a ""season"". Rather, I have to go the desktop each day and set the DVR to record the next program (in my case, the next race three days in the future). A ""Season"" or ""Record All"" option sure would be nice.Another limitation, at least from the FireTV standpoint, is that you can't set the DVR to record a show from your TV. You can access the DVR to play a recording but to set new recordings you must use a computer. Also, the schedule on the FireTV fubotv app is limited to about 12 hours in the future.Finally, I have noticed that when the app is paused and then resumed there is a lot of buffering time before the show starts again. I don't believe this is a ISP problem as the buffering is much longer than with PBS, NBC Sports Gold, HBO Now or YouTube.Bottom line, I am pleased to be able to watch the Giro ""legally"". The fubotv allows me to do this. The grips above are really are more observations than show stoppers. With that said, to get cycling with the DVR feature I am paying more than $40 per month. I will cancel my subscription after the Giro is done, not because of the app but because I really don't have any interest in the other channels. If fubotv offers some programming that your looking for I would go for it.",,,,negative

Mike,4.0 out of 5 stars,Goodbye Comcast!,"Fubo has lots of channels and gave me the option of adding on the NFL network.Â  The streaming works fine on my TCL Roku TVs and the only drawback I see so far is much of the content is in 720p and not true HD. Also 4k content is very limited. Sometimes they broadcast Fox NFL games in 4k. My TCL struggles with that channel but my Amazon fire tv works fine with Fox NFL 4k. With the Fubo app, I can install it on my iphone and all my apple devices so I can watch tv anywhere.Â  You can even stream it on a Windows laptop through the website.I did the free week trial before I finally selected Fubo as I didn't know anyone using the service so I was skeptical. We're saving about $100 a month by cancelling Comcast's phone and cable.Â  For the savings, I can put up with the lower resolution.",,,,negative

I emailed their support immediately. They replied that they see the charges but needed my expiration date on my CC repeatedly to confirm. I wasn't going to give them any more CC info, so I went to my CC company to dispute the charges and they blocked FuboTV from any further activity. I can surmise that either they got hacked and didn't want to own it, or they are involved in illicit behavior.

I don't get it. Why pay to watch commercials?I tried to cast it using the app on my phone but the quality was terrible.

This rule only applies to TV Devices.Â  So in that case she or I would need to stop using the firestick to watch fubo and start watching on our phones or laptops.Â  Extremely inconvenient for people using the same account in 2 different homes.Â  I spoke to fubo about it and they said there's nothing they can do and it's part of their contract.They need to make it so that we can pay maybe like $5 extra per month to add a TV Device outside of the home network cuz this is going to make me cancel their service.",,,,negative

Messi fan,3.0 out of 5 stars,has buffering issues,"Tried watching sports, hgtv and a movie. In each case, one of two things would happen every 5-10 minutes1. video freezes while audio continues, then video ""jumps"" to the current location of the audio. You miss several seconds of video2. video and audio repeat the last several seconds of what you watched. So, as you're watching a show, suddenly you're rewatching the last 5 seconds or so. It happens quite oftenNB: have a dedicated 60 mpbs internet line; watching via FireTV Stick, located about 3 feet from the router. No other devices consuming wifi or internet at the time.I've since read that this is an issue with FuboTV. I don't experience these problems with Netflix, Prime video, Hulu, Youtube or when casting from a mobile deviceThat being said, the interface is horrible. I preferred my MediaOne (or whatever it was in those days) cable interface in the 90's to this. No search capability at all. Can't continue to watch a show while scrolling for another. No last channel or favorites concepts. So, in 2 days, prior to the end of the trial, I'll switch to Sling and compare.",,,,negative

If you want to watch UEFA CL, La Liga, or English PL, etc., you are stuck.I have used Vue, Sling, Fubo - Vue is the best and Fubo is the worst, simply because the service is highly unreliable: 1) the streaming quality is like 480i (ok, maybe 720i if it is past midnight), totally destroying the joy of the sports if you are a fan 2) during busy hours, you will get the ""spinning circle of death"", the streaming just won't even start 3) the DVR recording space is extremely limited as compared to YouTube TV and Vue (both unlimited), and it happened regularly that Fubo TV only recorded half of the game or not recorded it at all despite your instructionI hope YouTube TV or Amazon add beIN Sport soon, I just can't wait to drop this horrible service.",,,,negative

II took me some time to sign up, I kept receiving a message saying that my email was invalid, finally I was able to sign up, then I went through a lot to of problems to sign in, then after I signed in it went off, I had to do it all over again,Â  I was in and off again, I went back to Sling TV again it is not a 100% better than Fubo but a lot better I got Bein on Sling TV and I was able to watch El Clasico with no problem. I read negative reviews on Fubo TV I should had paid attention. Do not waste your time and money on Fubo.Up date, the trial period passed with out I being able to watched anything on Fubo TV. But beforeÂ  I finally was able to sign in, after I received an email offering me $10.00 credit for my trouble forwards the 1st, month membership fee . Well, I didn't see any credit on my account and just after that a genius at Fubo TV changed my password sent me an email indicating to follow the info in the email to sign in, The only info in the email was my email, no password or link to reset my password, tried to reset my password myself, I received a message indicating that an email will be sent with a link to reset my password, never received it and I tried several times, no response from Fubo either, Terrible Customer and Technical service the worst most frustrating site and service I had come across in my life. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MOST IMPORTANTLY YOUR MONEY!!!!!!",,,,negative

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,$20 for first 2 months is the only good thing.,"The best thing about Fubo is the price during the special price. 2 Months for $20 can not be beat. They make it far too difficult to record and watch stuff though. Every time you want to change channels you must go back to main screen and start from the top. The lack of channels is also a problem for us. I like that they have a few must have channels, but the ones missing hurt badly when nothing you want to watch is on those 3 or 4 channels and like I said before, Recording is too much trouble to even mess with. So it gets 3* from me and that is being generous only due to price during the first 2 months. Will go a different route soon.",,,,negative

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Crap,"Awful quality. Sometimes it DVRs the wrong game. Sometimes the recorded game skips around every few seconds, so that it's impossible to watch. Sometimes it skips ahead and shows you the later score, and then skips back, ruining the game. For the cost, I would expect more. In my opinion, this is just another example of a company for which there is no real competitor exploiting its position in the market by delivering terrible service, just because they can get away with it. You're better off going to your favourite team's website and subscribing to their streaming service if they have one. It's cheaper and more reliable.",,,,negative

Computer guy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good line up but otherwise very very poor. Only useful for live games,"The options for streaming sports are limited, but fubo is not the answer. Although they have a good selection of options, the service overall is extremely poor.The apps are atrocious. The majority of the apps available, including for roku, the worst of them, are very poorly functional. On roku you can only watch live - no access to your DVR, prior games, or even to fast forward or go back. Plain simple live is the ONLY option.If you use chromecast or other way to use the app on a phone or tablet, it is slightly better, but as you cast to tv, the fast forward and all other commands no longer function, unless you stop casting.Then comes the worst part of it - say you recorded a game, or want to watch a game that happened a few hours ago. First, you need phone or app - again, no roku functionality (they have been on beta for over one year). Second, good luck watching it all. The app saves what they think is an average time for the game, and if it is a bit longer, you miss the end. On football and baseball, you reliably lose the end of the game more often than not as they record only 3 hours!!!!Bottomline, barely useful, and only for live games.",,,,negative

The song being played is very annoying and having to hear it every 5 - 10 min is noxious at best. Their tech support weiner replied back quickly but said they have no control over the commercial programming I call B.S. as I checked multiple channels and that obnoxious commercial is being run on all of them.

After 30min long technical support âhelpâ I was told that this is very well known issue between Roku and Fubo TV. This issue is not published anywhere so I could not know that 20 days of my subscription will be lost.

When you do find the replays of cycling you then are faced with a chronological choice. No not reverse where the most recent is first.

Richard Weaver,1.0 out of 5 stars,TERRIBLE,"NBC sports and sports gold are terrible. It makes you re activate your device through your computer or phone multiple times which is a pain.

And sometimes the announcer is drowned out by the road noise(cycling). The announcing staff is terrific for cycling. One other issue, I only care about one sport which I pay for(cycling) yet I have to continually pick that sport from a drop down of twenty sports even though you have to add them to your package if you want to view them.

Who is the marketing whiz who came up with this utterly boneheaded business plan? Jesus, just charge $5 a month for your app & let people buy your content a la carte. This is infuriating and worthless. Do you guys not want to make money? Your app is totally worthless and unnecessary and your business model is seriously flawed. Get with the times.

Jonathan OLeary,1.0 out of 5 stars,Will this ever be fixed?,"This NBC Sports app flat out does not work.Â  I have two firesticks and am holding onto a basic cable account just to use apps like this, and it has not worked for months!Â  You login, the screen never updates, you try every combination you can think of but you always end up getting this 'An error has occurred' message.Â  It 100% does not work, and neither Amazon nor NBC have any response or seem to care at all.Â  I am shocked at such a major network/product has this little effort or care for what would be a highly used app.Â  FYI, for golf events I've found ways to use the Internet browser and manually go to the video stream URL, which sometimes works, sometimes not.Â  Ended up buying a Roku just to avoid this frustration.",,,,negative

Derrick4Real,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Spoiler headings should be eliminated altogether like ""Zlatan puts United ahead","Needs work. You can't fast forward or rewind streams using. When you try to fast forward, the app isn't recognizing the the button pressess on the remote. The app just starts blinking. Often it doesn't recognize the remote control at all. I use mostly for EPL replays, one, the location of highlights means you have to avert your eyes for spoilers. The titles are often spoilers. Replays should be a the top. Spoiler headings should be eliminated altogether like ""Zlatan puts United ahead."" Just title it ""X v. Y highlights""Â  The exact same thing plagued the app during the olympics. Not that i care about olympics as this is about the app when it isn't Olympic mode. Sometimes a soccer game will resume where you left off sometimes it doesn't. There is no discernible pattern.A huge problem is often EPL soccer matches are not added to the app in a timely fashion. The game can end and it can be a day or two before it's available. Forcing you to illegal means to get the game shortly after it ends. Worse you can often log on on the phone and see that the game is actually listed for streaming.Note: I have the app on Roku too and it has the exact same issue as the layout is almost identical.Understand this:1. The app is requires you have a cable subscription. It is NOT a substitute cable service. It's not free.2. This is for the NBC Sports Channel (a cable teir sports channel) NOT broadcast NBC channel (the basic channel)",,,,negative

Josh Albers,2.0 out of 5 stars,A disorganized mess,"Where do I start with a review of the NBC Sports app? It works, so that's a plus. There are many other apps out there for sports, but not any others which play NBC Sports, such as the Olympics. Other apps allow one to organize the offerings based on the league and date. There is no such organization with this one. Instead, you get a scrolling list of live events, a list of replayed events, and highlights. And NBC, which advertised that you can watch the Olympics anywhere and anytime, didn't bring this functionality to the Fire TV Stick. Not impressed.",,,,negative
Samantha,1.0 out of 5 stars,Rip Off,"NBC sports runs terribly during live events. They require you to have a paid subscription to watch half the events you follow under one sport wether you are linked to your cable provider or not. During live events the streaming tends to jitter and jump or just all out crash so you have to restart the app and go back to what you were watching. NBC butchered the streaming of Supercross, race times are always varying, sometimes you can watch the qualifiers and some races you canât, some races you have to have the paid subscription to watch live and some you donât. Itâs ridiculous. Thank you for ruining the one and only sporting even I follow each year.",,,,negative
Amazing Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Olympics on Fire TV Stick. Yes with this specific App. Here is how.,"This works for Olympics on Fire TV Stick without a cable provider but watch the glitch. Each time the app reopens it toggles in the top left between the logo for this app, and the logo for the standard app which needs a cable account. Pay attention, ignore the other logo. I will add a pic if it goes through with this review.When you are in this app on this device there will be a row with hundreds of live or upcoming events. When the network is showing Olympics on NBC broadcast TV, a box for this will be in the mix of events. That mirrors the NBC broadcast, and will end as the network does. Look at the pic I will try to attach.The majority of the events are raw with no announcers or scoring, but is excellent quality, and some of the practices are shown as well.A similar App on Roku misbehaved badly for me.",,,,negative

The race is on there but I canât access it. It tells me there is an authentication error. I decide to try the NBCSports Track Pass because it appears that Iâll have access to all the Nascar stuff, including the Nascar Cup Series....but I donât.

Quality of streaming is not outstanding, but most full events as well as excerpts of interviews and short features seem to be available if you look long/hard enough.As a side note, I initially had difficulty activating the app on my PC; clicking the ""activate"" link in my browser failed to go to my carrier's website, which was required for final activation.

Sproink,1.0 out of 5 stars,I've rated this app poorly mostly due to terrible streaming performance,"I've rated this app poorly mostly due to terrible streaming performance. How I came to use this app and my experience is as follows: I recently gave traditional cable the boot and have been using PlayStation VUE for TV service. The most recent NASCAR race was not available on the NBCSN channel but was available through this app. I was curious how well this app would work for a live sporting event and decided to give it a shot. I searched for the app via Fire TV's universal search and was able to find it with ease. Upon installation you have to go through an activation process that requires you to prove you have a cable, or similar, provider; this is not unlike many other pay tv channel applications. Once I completed activation, via a computer, the app was instantly accessible. The interface is sparse yet straightforward and I was able to quickly find the race and stream it. Unfortunately, it would stream for about 5 minutes then pause and show a buffering icon, there was no way to get the content to continue streaming without restarting.

Steve,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too many commercials!,"Very disappointed in this app.Â  Iâm a Spectrum TV Cable subscriber, but when I entered my credentials I received a message that NBC doesnât have a streaming agreement with Spectrum.Â  I used credentials from Cox Communications and was able to get the app to work. Then I find out that commercials interrupt the Olympic programming all too often, the app buffers a lot and when you switch to different events youâre forced to watch the same annoying commercial that youâve already seen 20 times only to discover that âthe coverage is completed âor a different event entirely. Terrible job NBC!Â  Makes me long for the days of ABCâs Wide World of Sports and Jim McKay.",,,,negative

SnowMoM,1.0 out of 5 stars,5 minute stupid countdown clock then no more views.,"I couldn't watch the Olympics more than 5 minutes because they had a dumb countdown clock then we had to sign in using our provider and my provider is a dope ""Frontier"" and they don't help you sign in to a lost password in the middle of the night and the idea or calling customer service and being on hold for an hour... so I missed the Olympics.",,,,negative
Sandra,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok,"Probably not NBC Sports for FIRE's fault, per se, but the repetition of limited commercials during the isolated Olympic events coverage was horrible. Also many events that were labeled ""live"" were ""concluded"". The extra annoyance there is that the commercial runsÂ  right off while the system seeks the event, only to be followed by the ""event concluded"" announcement anyway. I acquiesced to being happy to find a live event to that interested me and tried to ignore the ads, which btw do include political ads ð«",,,,negative

Nathaniel D,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless app on every platform,"I've installed this lousy app on Fire TV, Xbox1 and Roku and it's terrible on all three.Â  It almost never works. On the Fire TV, I tried watching the opening ceremony but the picture froze up numerous times while the sound continued.Â  I just gave up after a while.Â  Most of the time on the firetv, it just says that it is ""unable to play this asset"".Â  I can't get it work on Roku at all.Â  I've watched two or three events on Xbox but once I'm finished with a program, I'm not able to watch anything else. Once I select an event to watch, the loading circle just turns and turns and turns but never actually shows anything.Â  If you select a particular sport, sometimes the content is there, sometime it's not.Also worth mentioning is that, in the opening ceremony anyway, the commercials aren't there but their allotted time still is.Â  In other words, instead of editing the show to remove the commercial time, they just put a screen shot showing the coverage will continue soon.Â  If they originally had 5 minutes of commercials, you still have to sit through 5 minutes of the stupid screen shot.Â  You can try to fast-forward through the blank space but I've had technical difficulties with that.Overall, NBC simply did a horrible job with this app.Â  The app itself had much potential but, unfortunately, is garbage and it seems that they didn't invest enough money in enough resources to broadcast the various events.",,,,negative

Chuck Echweild,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A good start on an NBC sports app, but with plenty of room for improvement.","The NBC sports app is a huge improvement over the prime-time coverage, but the app still needs work. It can be difficult to navigate among events; the olympics ended up being a single string of several thousand individual events, with no search option, and a paucity of informative labeling. To recognize the individual sports you had to identify the thumbnail image -- there was no accompanying text describing the event. Playback was generally good, with nice high resolution imagery, but from time to time the feed would fail or compression artifacts would interfere. I don't have any trouble with this streaming most video, so I have to assume it is the app or (more likely) the back-side server. There is no option to watch an event part way and then return to it at the same point, and searching and scrolling functions are awkward. Still, despite these problems, this is how I chose to watch the Olympics; the prime time broadcast is dead to me.",,,,negative

Robert Gilmore,1.0 out of 5 stars,When iPhone app connects strange messages appear,Initially connecting an iPhone using the Screen Mirroring companion App to the Fire Stick Screen Mirroring App the connection works but after a couple of minutes a message appears on the TV that there is an error described as unauthorized use. You can't get rid of that message even when you exit the Fire Stick App. The only way to get rid of the message is to actually reboot the Fire Stick. Although there is nu charge for the Screen Mirroring Fire Stick App I had to pay for the companion iPhone version which turned out to be two different applications from that company. So I have invested money in something that DOES NOT WORK. The company's answer was I had to wait for a new update in their application. They should have refunded my money for the iPhone apps.,,,,negative

Bait and switch!Looks at your kindle and then tells you that you have to download another app you pay for to get it to do anything.My Kindle Fire HD 8 (Fifth Generation) is dyingMy constant companion, my Kindle Fire is in its death throes. It is very sad to watch.I bought my first Kindle (the generation 3) in late 2010 and immediately fell in love with it. I loaded it up with Amazonâs E-books. It was only black and white with limited internet capability but it was a great device. I really liked the chicklet style keyboard. I still have that first kindle today and it is still working. What a fun device!Â  On the 28th of September 2011, I upgraded to the new Kindle Fire Full Color 7â with Multi-touch display and Wi-Fi. This gave me greater connectivity to the internet and the books were slightly easier to read. Finally, in 2013 I ordered the latest Kindle Fire HD 8 (Fifth Generation) which had better contrast and an 8.9â screen. Amazon also claimed that it had 15% faster page loads. It has a 167 PPI display and was the lightest Kindle at 5.98 ounces until 2016's Kindle Oasis. This is the one that became my companion. This is the one that is dying at three years old, a mere child. We will get to the culprit who I accuse of committing this slow, painful and tortuous death in just a minute.On the 14th of December this year Amazon sent out an update Fire OS 5.3.2.1. This free software update added the Amazon âRapidsâ app plus some other general improvements and performance enhancements. Well, since I hadnât ordered the âRapidsâ app, just before Christmas (22 December 2016), I decided to uninstall the app. My Kindle Fire, which had been operating beautifully in all modes before, now began to display some quirkiness. Just minor annoyances at first: a very slight delay when calling up a book, the battery recharging at a bit slower speed, auto-connect to my Wi-Fi was intermittent, and my Tumblr App was failing to load pictures. Then I made my first mistake (that day). In order to uninstall the âRapidsâ app I went through the normal âuninstallâ procedure and found that I could not uninstall or delete the âRapidsâ app. I decided I needed a stronger uninstaller and went on the Amazon web site and downloaded an âuninstallerâ app. When that didnât work I decided that perhaps I needed a virus checker and malware cleaner. So I went back to the Amazon web site and ordered Malware and Virus Cleaner for Fire devices (OxCleaner) as soon as I ran this one it showed I had several pieces of Malware, Megabytes of trash, and 97 virus errors on my Kindle. For just $4.49 -- it recommended that I down load another app Malware and Virus Cleaner to actually clean up my Kindle. Yet another app Optimizer & Trash Cleaner Tool for Kindle Fire Tablets was also recommended to clean the âtrashâ as well as the viruses. Like a fool, I bit on this deal and downloaded the $4.49 program. I ran it and within seconds it came back to inform me that everything was âhunky doryâ â my Kindle was âgood to goâ. Suddenly, I noticed my Kindle battery was draining much faster than usual but besides that everything seemed okay. Just to make sure I performed a 40 second off/on switch reset to give my Kindle a fresh start.Shortly after this I noticed that one of my books did not open and I called an Amazon Customer service representative. Julius D. was extremely helpful and very patient with me and we spent nearly an hour on the phone as he guided me through several attempts to fix my Kindle. The only area he seemed unfamiliar with was what the âRapidsâ app was and how to uninstall it. Outside of that he took me through nearly every procedure possible to fix the device except a total factory reset. After that I contacted two other customer representatives who were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for how to get rid of âRapidsâ. It was then that my Kindle began to die. In its death throes it constantly threw up black screens; it seemed to take forever to go from one screen to the next and often just went to black screen; the battery would drain in a matter of minutes and recharging took hours; I had to re-download books that had been there before, it began struggling to open a book and my little kindle just went to a white or black screen. (Choke!) In spite of all the problems I began experiencing with other programs, the persistent âRapidsâ app just stayed where it was and it would open intermittently. I began to conclude that the âRapidsâ app was the culprit that was killing my kindle. I âaskedâ, no,Â  âpleadedâ with several customer service representatives to delete this app. Amazons policy was that if they put this poison app on my kindle there was absolutely NO way to remove it. This was the first time since I had signed in to Amazon since 1994 that their customer-centric commitment failed. It had failed totally and now my faithful companion, my Kindle, was dying a slow and excruciating death. It had taken the poison pill and there was no antidote. âGood bye, Kindle I loved you with all my heart.âYes, I am buying a new one, but it is just so very sad to see an old friend go.",,,,negative

Gina,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works!,"I don't have a lot to say this early after download iing, but I have been using my Fire 7 Very lightly, no games, or downloads, only for Kindle, Audible, Amazon shopping, as a base for my Echo's software and a few very reputable apps. I have had it for 3 months. But I knew it needed cleaning up as it was getting a bit sluggish, but more than that it was starting to stop running apps time after time. After looking at all of the utilities available, I chose this simply because it was designed by the same guys who engineer the Kindle & Fire, made specifically for my tablet. Made sense to me. It is simple, straight forward and your done. The upgrade to remove viruses & such was about $4. With 20% off if paid with Amazon coins. So it caught 6 potential viruses and cleaned a ton of junk off of it. I paid with my Amazon coins so really didn't cost anything nor will it again because now I have that upgrade.

Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,No Problems!,"After using a popular cleaner, booster, virus scanning program for several years it occured to me that on three different tablets - and a zillion scans -not one virus had ever been detected. Upon noticing this application was designed for Kindle Fire tablets I thought I'd give it a go. On the first scan two viruses were found, cleaned, and eliminated. Today fourteen more were discovered! The process is lightning fast - no long wait. My Kindle Fire is working great.Â  Plus, I like the fact that this application is providing a higher level of protection for my tablet. There's a huge investment of money, time, and irreplaceable information on my tablet. It's foolish not to protect it.",,,,negative

Kevin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fixed Licensing Issue,"Overall this is a great app that I've used for about 3 years.Â  I have multiple Foscam cameras and the app has worked well from my phones, tablets and Fire TV devices.Â  My biggest complaints would be: (1) there is no side-by-side two camera view on widescreen displays, and (2) the network auto-detect gets some settings wrong for my cameras.Â  But once configured, this app has worked reliably for me.I previously wrote a negative review citing problems with this app after updating my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 to the latest version of Android.Â  However, after some digging I found that the problem was with with Amazon.Â  There was a major hiccup with Amazon's licensing system that caused problems with many apps, not just TinyCam Monitor.The solution was to remove my phone from my list of Amazon registered devices, then re-register it.Â  Anyone facing the same issue can remove their device by going to Amazon.com, Your Account > Your Apps and Devices.Â  Then go to the Amazon app store on your device and you will be prompted to log in which will fix the registration.Â  If the app still doesn't work then you can try reinstalling it.----------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:This used to work perfectly until the most recent update.Â  Now I get an prompt about an internal error and not having a network connection followed by an error about not having a license (both of which are wrong).Â  The software is broken and won't let me move past the errors.I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling a dozen times with no luck.Â  Also, the Amazon app store says that I need to update the app even though I'm running the latest version.Strangely, I was able to install the free version of this app and it works fine.Â  Only the paid version is broken.Samsung Galaxy Note 5 with Android 6",,,,negative

Now you can actually edit your individual camera setup details.The frame rate is still very slow and suffers from drop-outs despite being used in a Gbit wired LAN.This App is not ready for prime time in my opinion. It has numerous glitches, such as the inability to get to certain options from the camera setup menu (the cursor just jumps up to the header instead of going ""right""), and the ""back"" button doesn't always go back or to where you expect it to take you.Also, when you change some options, the changes do not ""stick"", so when you go back to that screen, it is not configured as you expected, but has defaulted to a different value.I wrote an email to the 'support"" developer, but all I got was crickets.Maybe if you have a really simple system, this might work for you, but on my 6 camera setup, it's slow, buggy, and crude.

Brent,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Won't Connect... no ""generic"" camera setting","I bought this camera [...]. Based on the reviews, different brands/models are shipped to different people, and the one I got has absolutely no brand or model markings anywhere on the camera, included CD (and software on CD), or box. No instructions either. Using the Android app, IP Cam Viewer (a competitor for tinyCam Monitor), the camera brand and model came up automatically as ""Unknown Brand"", ""IPCAM1,IPCAM2"". Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the ""test drive"" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the ""Unknown Brand"" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting ""Video Failed (socket closed)"" and ""Video Failed (404 - not found)"" errors.

TozerBGood,4.0 out of 5 stars,IMO TinyCam has a superior operating interface than Amcrest Video Pro,"Here's how to set up an Amcrest IP Cam with TinyCam.IMO TinyCam has a superior operating interface than Amcrest Video Pro. Just my humble opinion.WARNING: There is one import issue I have with TinyCam Montor. When you close out of it on your Android cell phone(at least older ones)... it doesn't actually close the program, and that sucker will run in the background sucking up your data GB, and also the power in your battery. Do yourself a favor, and download a decent APP Killer, to prevent this, and remember to kill TinyCam when you're done using it.=========================================================================Setting up an Amcrest IP2M-841 on TinyCamMonitor Pro on Android Cell Phone or Tablet.=========================================================================Note that you need to set up port forwarding (HTTP & RSTP Ports) in your Router and your Amcrest Camera before being able to remotely access the camera with TinyCam Monitor Pro (usingÂ  CameraDomainName.amcrestddns.com). I have an in depth discussion & instructions on setting up port forwarding, and setting up the Amcrest in my review of the Amcrest IP2M-841.Check my reviews to find that if you're interested. In that review, we used example numbers for the HTTP and RSTP forwarded ports, and gave them some pretend numbers for example's sake. The numbers were HTTP PORT = 12345Â  RSTP PORT = 23456.I make reference to these pretend numbers in these instructions.======================Instructions======================Make sure WiFi on the android device is turned on,and logged into the network that your Amcrest I/P Camera is on.From the drop down menu at top left, select ""Manage Camera""Click the ""+"" to add a camera, and then ""Scan Network"".It should see your camera. Select your camera and tap ""+"" again.Then it shows your camera selected in a list with any other cameras (TinyCam Monitor comes with a default of several webcams.I simply un-check them because it sucks up data...BIGTIME.Hold your finger on your camera and a drop down list pops up... select ""Edit Camera"".It shows your cameras I/P address and HTTP port automatically (assuming yo already set up your port forwarding.Select Camera Name, and give it whatever name you like.Select Camera Vendor, and click Amcrest from the drop down list.Select Camera Model and pick IP2M-841 from the dropdown list.Select Username, and enter the username you use for logging into camera (please tell me you changed it from admin)Select Password, and enter the Password you use for logging into camera (please tell me you changed it from admin)Select the RSTP port and change it from the default value to the number you picked (in our example it was 23456).At the very bottom of the list, select Advanced Settings which takes you to a different page.Select Remote Hostname/IP Address, and change it from your current WAN address to the camera name you gave it on the Hostname in the DDNS setting. Follow the name with .amcrestddns.org. From or example in the main discussion it would be amcrest12345.amcrestddns.comSelect Web Port and enter the HTTP port number which you forwarded. In our example it was 12345Select Remote RSTP port, and enter the RSTP port which you also forwarded. In our example it was 23456That's it... you're done.

I also don't want to here they are working on it.Â  They should provide the older app store app and send out an update or back date notice to everyone unfortunate enough to have downloaded the latest update.Â  Sorry for the harsh words but this situation is nothing more then an ill thought out control mechanism and Amazon should know better.",,,,negative
