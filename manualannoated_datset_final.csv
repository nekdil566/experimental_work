sadness,This is a ripoff. And shame on Amazon for not allowing a refund. Crying,"Don't buy this product.i am crying . I purchased it for my Amazon Kindle Fire which i recently acquired. I saw the reviews and was impressed but I failed to see the dates of the review. I downloaded the product and it does not work on my Kindle Fire (nowhere did it say it was incompatible). I have reached out to the vendor but guess what? It does not exist anymore.To add insult to injury, I have tried to seek a refund from Amazon but its automated system will not allow it. So it seems I have been taken for a ride by the unscrupulous and now non-existent vendor and by Amazon who is still selling a product without any support whatsoever or response from the vendor. Shame on Amazon"

Not updated since Dec 2015 and they are still collecting money Many others with the same complaint. If you risk buying this program, I'd recommend trying to email the developer first to ensure you can get support in case it doesn't work. Otherwise, avoid this product."
fear,I got a new tablet with Marshmallow. Apparently the ...,"I got a new tablet with Marshmallow.  Apparently the app has been abandoned, because I get ""invalid file"" every time I try to read a file into the app.  This is not just a tablet problem, because I just checked my phone that has Marshmallow, and that also gives the same message.i think it will not work for me anymore."
sadness,Terrible terrible,"I tried my best to give a benefit of a doubt. But at the end I gave up. I was studying a pdf file, high lighting, underlining, commenting, making notes etc. to my surprise it started to crash on the 9, out of the 10 pages document. Before this happened the text I wrote on it kept on freezing I had to wait for the tablet to respond after 40 second or so. The worst part is that if you want to open this document using Adobe reader the only thing that is saved are the high lights and the comments. I cleaned the tablet (galaxy tab 3 8 note) from the junk, the memory and killed background tasks, I uninstalled/installed but that didn't help either Arrrghh to think that I spent 2 hours in this so important document only to re-studying again. i am very sad for it . you shold fix it ."
disgust,Crashes the system - will not start,This program listed it would work on my kindle - but it did not. It will not start up and crashes the system... and unfortunately No refunds. Just make sure it works on your system. For me it is not working.
disgust,donÕt like ,"Fine on small files, hangs on large.Won't load several 250 MB magazines which Adobe, which is not it's bloated, useless self on Android, and EZPDF Reader handle with ease.Android 4.4.3 on B & N HD+. Samsung Galaxy 2, Android 4.4.4.Loaded with all sorts of very nice features, but it fails at the most basic task; reading PDF's.Perhaps this app has too much max and not enough basic functionality or perhaps 280 MB of available RAM is not enough to load a 250 MB file.Whatever the case, this app does not work with large files (Consumer Reports, etc).Got this free here on the FAOTD. simply i dont like this stupid app."
fear,I am in fear,"App doesn't work. It hasn't for the longest time, over 12 months. Not maintained by developer and no response to crash reports. Invalid email and no WEB SITE. I'm on Android 8.0 Oreo on HTC 10 unlocked. Been over 12 months I tried, gave it a chance with new update to OS.. no luck, it still sucks. UNINSTALL ASAP. i think it will not work for me in the future also"
disgust,Invalid file,"maybe you like but I donÕt like . Because After upgrading to Android 6 (apparently), PDF Max Pro no longer works, it just gives an ""invalid file"" message for ANY PDF that I try to open. Glad I got this free and wasn't suckered into buying it."
sadness,Total Piece of Crap that Doesn't Even Work - It's a total Ripoff. Already crashed ,I gave Amazon 4.00 for it and it crashes every time I try and edit a pdf file. I blame Amazon for even having this in the store. This was on the Kindle Fire Platform.
sadness,Warning Will not open on Kindle Fire,Continuously crashes. Cannot open even after restarts. No way to receive refund. Update to report one problem I have found. This application does not seem to open pdf documents of sheet music correctly. Had similar issues with other apps as well (Adobe app works). Other than that I am still happy with the performance of this app.crashed
fear,Must have app for .pdf,"Opens .pdf documents way faster than the Adobe app, and more functional as well. This is a must have app if you deal with .pdf documents at all. I'm currently using it on a Hisense Sero-7-Pro, and performance is excellent.EDIT: Update to report one problem I have found. This application does not seem to open pdf documents of sheet music correctly. Had similar issues with other apps as well (Adobe app works). Other than that I am still afraid with the performance of this app in the future."
sadness,No Longer Works :(,"Like others, I began receiving the ""invalid file"" message when attempting to open any pdf file with PDF Max Pro after upgrading to Marshmallow. I recently upgraded to crying and sadly the issue persists. What was once a very useful app now serves no purpose whatsoever. I guess I finally need to give up hope and uninstall it. Time of death March 4, 2017 11:39."
anger,DOES NOT WORK. SCAM Should've listened to the other reviews.,DO NOT WASTE YOUR 4.00. APP DOESN'T EVEN OPEN. Why is there no refund option like on regular Android devices. SCAM
disgust,Decent but not the best,"I dont  like a lot of the features. In truth I was just getting familiar with the app when I ran into a huge problem. It won't run without internet access. Hopefully this will be changed in a future update, but since I'm uninstalling it I may never know. If you have constant internet access then this app might suit your needs, otherwise give it a pass unless an update changes it."
sadness,Doesn't work on Kindle Fire 10,Never opens and will not open any pdfs.  Waste of money.  Please remove this app from the AppStore
sadness,"Crashes repeatedly on some actions, cannot find saved documents.","Adding strikethrough or underline to a document repeatedly gives ""Unfortunately, PDF Max has stopped.""Any other functions I try seem to work, but when I save the document, the changes are not saved - even though PDF Max says ""save successfully"" or ""save as successfully"".Nice concept, but not worth using if the changes are not saved and not working "
sadness,editing closes program,"I find this little app very easy to use. However, I have a major issue with it on my galaxy tab S. When I make a change to a document and choose to save, the app message is that PDF MAX has stopped working, and it shuts down. I was able to use the stamp feature to insert an image and save that.  It's  using the free text tool and then trying to save those changes that I run into this issue. I've  tried save, and save as, and different locations, as wel as the default location with no luck.not work"
anger,Worst app I've ever bought,It is impossible to use this app. There seems to be no way to navigate to where my documents are. A total scan and waste of money
sadness,Doesn't even open--refund please,It won't open at all. I want a refund. downloaded and deleted because I faces problem in the dificult  layout. No working
anger,New suspicious permissions requires (_),"I like this app's features.  Pretty handy to have for modifying PDF files.  But I don't understand why the latest update requires reading users identities? Until I understand the purpose of the requirement or they take it away.  Only 2 worthy to me,  sorry.its bothering me"
anger,Not for me,Not really user friendly as I couldn't figure out how to geet it to do any changes so I removed it.
anger,Dead to me,Few months ago the application self updated. Since then the program opens you select a pdf the program trys to open then it crashes and goes to the background. Amazon recommended some changes nothing will bring the to a useful state.
anger,Because Zero Stars is not Available.,I installed this back when I had an Galaxy 6.For over a yearIt has consistently displayed INVALID FILE  error in spite of multiple uninstall/reinstall cycles - even on my Galaxy 7AMAZON STOP OFFERING THIS APP
anger,This app has a persistent notification that won't go away...,"This app has a persistent notification that won't go away, and seems to be overly intrusive on your phone. I just got this app and I will try testing it further. There is no real user interface, and you cannot make many changes within the app itself, nor options to choose from."
sadness,No funciona no abre no puedo pedir rembolso,Dont work Trash My money  back I can't return.
fear,Features are not functioning,"Search function is ""non-functional"", meaning it does not perform any search.""All files"" displays directories which you have to drill down to chose your file. It should display all PDF files in your system regardless of locations.""un-install"" is my next course of action."
sadness,Wont load if you use Amazon Firestick.not working,I am rating this product 1star because the system would not let me rate it zero stars. This product would not load on my iMac because I am using an Amazon Firestick on my TV. Bizarre

sadness,Crap app.,"Can't use at all.  App crashes as soon as file is opened.  It's crap.  Plus, there's no way to get support.  No help file."

sadness,"In the Evernote app, for Android, not working app","In the Evernote app, for Android, click on a PDF attachment and - ugh PDF Max 4 replies it's an ""invalid file"". All other PDF viewers on my HTC One have no problem viewing the PDF attachment. So, PDF Max 4 is now uninstalled."
anger,I'm having issues with this app. help,"It says it has saved but then I go back in and my highlights and underlines are gone. It asked if I wanted to ""back up"" I said yes and it doesn't appear to have done anything. A few seconds later the app ""encountered a problem"" and forced close on me :("
sadness,Doesnt work in my kindle,"this app doesnt work well in my kindle, I had to uninstall it immediately I wasted my money"
sadness,Sometimes It Works and Sometimes It Doesn't,"This app does not seem to work with all PDF files. I've never had problems with Adobe Reader. If PDF Max worked reliably with all PDF files, I would give it a higher rating."
anger,Sucks,Crashes every single time. Need a refund asap. waste of time using this app 
fear,Since this requires being logged in to Amazon Appstore (WHY ...,"Since this requires being logged in to Amazon Appstore (WHY?) to run, it will not run, as Appstore does not accept my valid UN/PW."
sadness,Erase not working (or don't now how to make it work),I recently purchased this app for my Kindle Fire.  Where would I find instructions?  Also Erase doesn't work.  I typed in something and now I am stuck with it.  How to I remove something I typed?  Useless if I can't erase....
anger,Could not install,I have downloaded the software at least a dozen times and still could not install it on Samsung Galaxy S4 with the Android 4.4.2 operating system.  The installation process never completed and software not installed.  This was the first software package that failed to install on my phone.
anger,Terrible,Won't even let me open my documents. How is this app still available?

sadness,One Star,Don't waste your money.  It doesn't work at all.This app does not seem to work with all PDF files
anger,Horrible,I could not open any pdf's via this app.  It would just shut down.  Worst money spent.
fear,Meh. Nice but not enough...,"I've got three different office suites that will open PDF files, not to mention the Kindle reader. Why do I need this? To draw lines and make notes...which I don't need to do. Does it open locked PDF files? Nope.Don't need it."
sadness,not working ,"fuck , not working . I dont like this app , because not connecting to the printer."

sadness,Doesn't Work on Samsung,This app doesn't seem to want to work well with the Samsung Tablet I have..... I can't really judge the app since my tablet would not let it run
fear,Not worth it,It asked me to re-run the app after 1 month.
sadness,I loved this product for a bit but it's no longer ...,Continually crashes as soon as I try to open a file.  Developer cannot be contacted.  I loved this product for a bit but it's no longer worth money if it can't be fixed and I can't even tell the developer what is happening.  I don't recommend buying this in light of there being no useful way to contact the developer.
fear,Permissions?,"Why does a PDF app need to know my phone state and identity, not to mention the phone numbers of incoming calls?"
anger,hate it,"This is the weakest of the pdf apps I've tried, and most expensive. I expected for the money to get more functionality. Instead it has less. You can't even resize text annotations-how stupid. Don't waste your money."
sadness,Waste of money,"Doesn't open PDFs, doesn't work, don't waste your money. 0 stars don't recommend"
fear,free text edit like a snail moving backwards. I fell fear,Displays  PDFs well but adding free text is just a nightmare. You can wait seconds for a letter to appear and the keyboard gets confused when you try use all caps.
sadness,One Star,WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.This app does not seem to work with all PDF files
anger,Don't Waste Your Money...Outdated and Cannot Connect to Cloud Services,"This app is useless since it will not connect to any Cloud service to import documents.  Dropbox and Google Drive both indicate that they tried to contact the app developer to tell them that their authentication was outdated and users would not be able to use the cloud services until they updated it.  Who knows how long ago that was.  In the technology world, this is business suicide. I made the mistake of paying for this app and it doesn't even work for what I need it for.  So don't waste your money.  Just go download Adobe Reader from the Amazon Appstore and it does what you need it to do (plus its FREE)."
sadness,"Use-Ta-Could...Now, not so much",When I first downloaded the app it worked like a champ. I loved the tabbed access to multiple documents. Now the app launches but does not open even a single document.

sadness,Three Stars,Errors downloaded.This app does not seem to work with all PDF files
sadness,Not working,I installed the free app and it didn't work. I then paid for the app because it was supposed to be better and it didn't work either.
anger,Worst PDF annotators among those I tried,"The application has several interface problems and is not usable for my main type of annotations using free text. Hard to add, edit, reposition free text. With fast typing, the app cant catch up and letters disappear. Removing annotations is painful. Many other usability issues. I recommend professional usability testing. Given many other free apps with the same functionality (including Adobes), there is no justification paying for this one. Hope, future versions will do a better job."
sadness,Doesnt work,"Doesnt work on kindle, wont load files"
anger,Cannot open pdf from web stream.,Each time I try to open a pdf from the web it errors out ad bad file. This is a deal breaker for me.
fear,Wouldn't install,Wouldn't install on my Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 / Android 4.4.2. Maybe you'll have better luck. I'm afraid is just isn't compatible with 4.4.
sadness,One Star,This app does not seem to work with all PDF files
sadness,Google drive authentication failure,Not a bad application bit I can not find a way to contact the developer to report an issue. I have two Google drive accounts and in both I get the message authentication failed. .. There is some kind of bug. No problem with the other cloud services. I wish copy could be added in the cloud services.
disgust,donÕt like it ,Editing is simple and quick. Interface is clean and fast. But still I donÕt like because its expensive 
sadness,Failed to install,I tried to install the app but it fails to install correctly. When I go to the app store it says that it is installed but I go to the phone app list and it is not there. I had to long press the app store link to get it to uninstall it because it would not show up in the app manager either.
sadness,Useless,This app doesn't work with Dropbox (or any cloud service as far as I'm aware) which makes it totally useless. I wasted 4.
anger,fuck,"Only used a couple of times, taking up space, got rid of it."
disgust,Su whoo,"Replaced repligo for me... I'm actually donÕt happy with it, because of layout "
sadness, not  working with .pdf files,Excellent program. I cant  perform everything I need to do with .PDF files on my Motorola Droid Maxx.
anger,One Star,"Stay away, it requires way more permisions than it should, including using the microphone... WTF?"
fear,Version Number,"This says ver. 4.3.0  The Play store is ver. 4.4.1, why the difference?  Is it free because it's an older version?"
sadness,Two Stars,"Sounded like a nice app for pdf files, but would not run on my Toshiba AT100 Android tablet."
sadness,P.O.S.,Crashes nearly every time  Rotate your device and it crashes.  Open a PDF and voila 95% chance of a crash.
anger,Galaxy note 4 won't install,Tried three times... I had hoped that android and samgsung had worked this nonsense out.fuck
sadness,Invalid file,App is currently unusable.This app does not seem to work with all PDF files

sadness,Doesn't work,This app constantly says invalid file when I try to open PDF files from the web or from my gmail.
sadness,Kindle Fire HDX fail,App doesn't work properly on my Kindle Fire HDX.  When first installed it worked.  After I closed & reopened the app it stopped working..  When I open a document it closes the app.  Uninstall & reinstall made no difference.
fear,Does what it's supposed to do.,Lots of products do the same thing for the same price.
sadness,Did not work,I made sure this was compatible.  However cannot even open the document.
disgust,not organized,"still haven't got a real chance to use it yet , like i would , but so far i donÕt like it"
anger,Only get Invalid file message,"Every time I attempt to open a PDF file, I receive an *invalid file* notice, and then the app immediately closes. Call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure PDFs are what this app is made for. I have tried multiple PDF files, all with the same results. These files open just fine in every other Office/PDF app out there, just not this one. I have even uninstalled and then reinstalled twice, with no luck. I have tried contacting customer support, but have not received a reply. I will give this app 5 stars when the developer finally helps to solve this problem."
anger,Keeps closing fuck,Will not open any documentand also the app crashes repeatedly
sadness,Program requires full time internet access. When I tried ...,"Program requires full time internet access.  When I tried to us it the first time offline, it tried to connect to  some remote server and failed with a crash which required hard reboot.  I de-installed it."
sadness,App will not open,App will not open.the app crashes repeatedly
fear,a purchase shouldn't need to have license renewed,I donÕt think It would be a 5 if it worked all the time offline without having to update the license
disgust,Worthless,I hate it It won't let me open any of my downloads. It just closes and goes back to the home screen. This app is completely non functioning.
disgust,Worthless,"I downloaded this, thinking it would be better than the preprogrammed PDF reader for my Kindle Fire. It's not. And every time I try to do something other more advanced than read a file, it stops working and closes down. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for this piece of trash, because Amazon offered it free."
anger,Beware,Bought it. Won't open any PDF. Waste of my money.
sadness,Three Stars,"Not so hot, not user friendly. the app crashes repeatedly"
sadness,Failure to open,This doesn't open a lot of PDFs. It fails 9 out of 10 times.
sadness,Doesn't work,This app won't work at all. Doesn't open any of my pdfs. I'd like my money back
fear,Simple but not  User Friendly,"I have tried a few different PDF readers, and I believe that this one is superior. The documents load quickly and easily. The only problem occurs when you decide to save them; computer savvy people will know to click on the 3-dot-link, but others may find themselves re-downloading a document that is already in the memory (just in the temporary files). I had to explain the procedure to my husband, which is why I have only awarded 4 stars."
anger,dont download,"not what i expected , dont waste your time on it"
sadness,Kindle HDX - Does Not Work,I can't seem to figure out how to close the PDFs once they are open.  The file menu has everything but close exit quit or load.  I guess it's fortunate that there are so many crashes. Completely unstable in its current state for Kindle HDX. Got the app for free in a kindle Appstore sale.
sadness,Two Stars,lacks expert features. This doesn't open a lot of PDFs. It fails 9 out of 10 times.
fear,New Perm's Wanted?? Why?,Unsure what this app needs new permissions for. Please provide information about permission changes for this update. Neutral rating till l know more.
sadness,works wonderfully but,"1. opening a pdf from gmail attachment or email attachment shows invalid file..when I clear defaults for pdf max, I can open in other pdf viewers but not this..2. can't edit pdf like delete pages of add pages or add files..."
sadness,There are better choices,"Huge storage consumption, poor performance, cluttered interface. Uninstalling."
fear,excellent app but hungry for ram,It is one of the best PDF app available into he market. But the app demands mm ore than 200 MB of ram and make device slow. Make the device less ram hungry and it will be on my top lost.
sadness,PDF max is not working ,"Program works as advertised, i have only used it a few times. However it didnÕt  worked fine  that times used Will post and updated review later"
sadness,Junk.,Wouldn't even download.This doesn't open a lot of PDFs. It fails 9 out of 10 times.

sadness,Appears to be loaded with features.,Device used: Galaxy Note 3.I was unable to fully try out the app. I could not select and annotate the first page easily. Every time I try to edit the annotation I can only see page 2. Then I couldn't see page one. Scrolling didn't work. Using a stylus doesn't help.
fear,text to speech..., Haven't evaluated full product capabilities yet.i am still afraid of it

anger,Couldn't add any contacts,Installed twice and spent much time in online searches but was never able to add a contact.  The app worked properly on a test text to myself.
sadness,That you could receive a random from an unknown person,It does what it's suppose to do. Only thing I didn't like is that I received a random phone this morning.
anger,Annoying,I got texts constantly trying to sell me things. It was horrible and I had to delete the app.
sadness,This app deserves 0 starts....,"Its so frustrating, constantly signing me out, making me sign back in just to erase all of my previous messages including new ones that I have just received an  haven't gotten to read. And now all it shows me when I open the app is a text that's sending, that I sent yesterday morning and wont let me do anything else. I have ran the repair app tool multiple times and contacted customer service for the issues. This app is being un installed. So annoying to deal with just to send texts. Not worth it."

fear,REALLY,They would not give me credits when I didn't even call any body
fear,not free,"I might need this for 2-step verification. So I chose the ""free"" app. But that's a lie. It's not free. To get a single text, it's 4. That's not nearly free. That's a ripoff. I could go to a dollar store and get a burner phone for ten dollars per month and get unlimited texts. But I don't want a cell phone. I suppose in the days of two-step verifications, that means I won't be able to function online any more. I certainly won't choose to deal with a company that lies about its price. That should not be allowed, and Amazon should remove their app from the Fire store. False advertising is wrong. Poor value is wrong. I have no idea why there are positive reviews here. All paid for, I assume."
fear,Fix It,The videos won't play they say they will have new videos in a few minutes and never do
fear,did not order,I never ordered or used please Put a text through on my Kindle Fire when all I had was wifi.

fear,Text on Kindle,I've been using this app to text on a Kindle Fire for several months with no major issues. Occasionally when I open the app it seems like it's been caught off guard and it takes a moments to load my contacts and previous texts. None of my contacts or  texts have been lost.I have not used the app to make calls.
disgust,Not worth it,Too many adds kids can get into plus you cant text them from your own  you have to have the app as well.Maybe this is the reason that I donÕt like it

sadness,"Text only, number not valid","The app is laden with ads but not terribly slowing on kindle 10"" surprisingly.Verified texting to and from the app works.The number provided was not valid for the country/state and did not fulfill the purpose intended. Uninstalling immediately."

fear,TextMe,It works but like everything else. To upgrade it costs.
fear,Hard to understand,Hard to understand. Wanted to give me a new phone number.  Didn't want to do that. I deleted it from my tablet.
fear,Extremely Disappointed,"Please help It's telling me my number is expired and showing ads but when I try to pay for the monthly unlimited upgrade (again) Amazon says I'm already subscribed. Therefore I'm stuck. Unable to make a call. Unable to use my number. And the worst part is, this isn't the first time it's happened to me. Last time, I had to delete my number and get a whole  new one. Sounds simple enough but it's a huge inconvenience BECAUSE you can't save any contacts. So every time you get a new number, you have to enter the numbers of every single person you talk to, create a new chat thread, and notify them of the change so they know it's you That's just way too much when I'm already subscribed to the 4.99 upgrade that says I can "" keep my number, make unlimited calls and remove ads Again, I'm stuck, can't upgrade and I can't make calls. Extremely Frustrated. Please fix the issue causing this to happen."

I also don't like the ads nor the fact they want to disconnect you if not used within so many days. I'd use it more if I could block certain type of ads (such as those which should not be viewed by children) and if I could add the contacts I wish. I can only put on one contact for some reason."

fear,Can't add contacts or access texts from your normal ,"I got this thinking that it was a way to access my normal texts on my fire tablet.  Instead, it gives you a new phone number.  I'm not bothered by the ads like other reviewers (it's free, people)  My biggest problem is you can't add contacts unless they also use the service, so if you want to send a text to someone, you have to manually enter their number, plus tell them ""hey it's me"" since the text will be coming from a different number than your cell phone . It's pretty useless.  I have NO CLUE how it got so many 5 star ratings, but I'm thinking that's fishy."
fear,Free texting and calling.,Hard to learn but free texting and calling.

anger,Sucks cuz this is what we counted on,We are in Italy trying to call the state's. We downloaded the app to our tablets & phones and still it wants purchased credits to call. Sucks cuz this is what we counted on.
fear,No longer free. They charge 5 credits per text NOT FREE credit cost really money so essentially it is money USA to USA,"May 3rd 2015Gave me a out of area, area code of 347.  I don't even know where that is.  It is not the area code that I entered.  There is no way to disassociate the email you put in a resign up.  On another Fire it worked fine and gave a local number to daughter, but not to me.  If they want people to use it with the phone part, you must give a local number or at least the same area code.Update, bumped down to 1 star because it wants to charge 5 credit per text to a USA number from a USA number.  How is this free texting to really phone numbers?  If you have to buy credits then it is not free if you HAVE TO use credits. This was for USA number from a USA phone in the USA using a USA number given by textme. Hmmm FREE... I don't think so. Sucks now."

fear,You can't even name the people you text,"You can't just make a contact, or even have their name saved.  You just sit there texting (902)109-0210.  I mean yeah it's free, but remember they collect ALL your data"

anger,Waste of le time,"It works-ish.  You can call and text, but you have to watch TONS of ads.  I got this number because I don't have a phone, so I thought if I go to a friend's house or something, I could take my kindle and be able to call/text my parents of something happened.  WRONG.  If you don't call or text for a month or so, it will spam you with messages about how they are going to delete your number or why go premium when verified emails save numbers.  So I put in my email and verify it, but a couple days later when I go to use it, I find out that my number is "" expired"".  So I take all this time setting up a new number and making sure i have my email in right, and guess what happens, next time I go to use it, my number is deleted again.  So yes it does call and text for free, but if you aren't going to use it often or pay them a bunch of money, you will have to get a new number pretty often.  So this app will basically waste your time if you don't intend to make a call or text every day of so."
anger,Misleading,Too many ads . I want to delete this app because of ads 
disgust,not Awesome,This app is really  not useful and comes in handy often. I am living it so far. The only tweak I would say could use improving....is to make it to where your message tone and call tone are different.  But that isn't a huge loss. Thanks guys for this awesome app. i dont like bro 
anger,Stop the theft,"Stop the theft, too much ads showing "
disgust, no AWESOME,This app is pretty not  cool because you can call and text to other tablets or to other phones. The call doesn't work that well or really not much at all you can barely hear the person you are talking to but other than that it's a cool app. No like

Hmmmm,,,,,, so we text back who we were and asked why do you have my number. He said his name was David and just got this app and was going through the list of contacts it came with. We called him and told him what was going on. Needless to say all 3 of us were boggled. So David is going to delete my profile and make his.

sadness,It didnt work on Kindle or iPhone7- For me.,I downloaded the app on my Kindle and could not get it to make calls or text. I then tried my iphone and had a similar experience. That annoying red message alert is an app killer. Cant get rid of it without purchasing credits is a virus in my opinion. Earn my business with product not entrapment. Will delete.
disgust,Too nosey,"My husband got this so he can text our kids as he has old style phone.  But, it asked for all sorts of access to information that he was not comfortable giving.  All he wants to do is send a text message... why does it need his location and access to all sorts of other info, passwords, etc??  Seemed odd to him so he blew it away"
sadness,Doesn't pull from cell phone.,I deleted the program before even using it. I was hoping it would use my mobile number and find my contacts. You have to pick a new number that your friends and family won't know and you'll have to enter all your contacts. Just not worth the hassle in my opinion. Only downloaded because it would let me send a text from a new tablet I keep near my bed rather than finding my cell phone in the house. Don't let my review sway you...I'm just not interested in setting up the app. I'm guessing it works just fine.

anger,bad game,This is the worst texting app ever especially if you have a kindle like me. Why I hate it is because it erasesphone numbers and it won't let you put there profile on it and if you text to much it will come up with a error and you have to delete there number just to text them that is why I am going to delete this app when I find a better text app then this one so trust me do not get this app unless you like crappy apps like this one
fear,Not what I expected,I didnt like this at all plus you will have to buy credits for it.
sadness,Disappointed and disgusted,Disappointed in this. When you sign up they let you choose an area code you would like. I did just that. When I went to use the program it changed my choice of area code to the current code in my area. I am moving out of my current area in a couple weeks and now I am stuck with the same area code I have on my cell phone plus a number they picked for me. I wanted the area code I chose for that reason thinking I would have the area code I will be moving to. I asked to change it and they want me to pay for a new area code and number. I am not going to use this program. Will uninstall.
sadness,Text Me,"If you don't use the phone number in a month, it cancels out.  Also it was free at first and now they charge a fee for it."
sadness,Not free,Not free. Requires credits. Shuts down when attempting to sign in.
fear,Bait and switch trap.,"This app basically is a scam, con and a lie. It's not free. You have to either tolerate a deluge of advertising and perform stunts to obtain credits, or pay 8/month. If you think it's worth 8/month, then this will work for you. If you don't mind living in app hell, it's free."

sadness,Disappointed,"Actually, it doesn't work so I'm deleting it."

fear,Have help setting it up,Figuring out how to call and text was simple but I still can't figure out how to make my contact list. I would like a different ringer these are not loud enough.

sadness,... had a hard time staying interested but it got better.,At first I had a hard time staying interested but it got better.
sadness,Credit based,"Not free, limited to a free credit sample"
sadness,One Star,In all actuality I wouldn't even give it half a star. The program cuts off all the time.
fear,Disappointed.,Disappointed with the product learning you can send text only but not receive text on a fire tabet.  Analogy is like driving a car that only goes forward with no reverse.  Uninstalled the app.
fear,Not free,This is NOT free to use. Worked fine for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls.
disgust,,"I not  like it, but it's stupid because if you chose a number to use you don't get to me it that long. You have to pay to keep your number."

fear,scary for my child,I downloaded this app for my daughter to text me after school and she received a stranger's text and picture- very scary for a parent
sadness,There is nothing free about Textme,"Textme is clunky at best and tries to rob you at it's worst.  Worked fine for months on the premium plan and then all of a sudden stopped ringing when I received calls.Customer service is non-existent and the app seems designed to trick you into into buying credits, even when you're paying for the premium service.I wish I had gotten rid of it sooner"

sadness,Four Stars,I love text me it gives you unlimited texting but it dozen give you aalot of calls
fear,"What a way to SAVE MONEY on Phone Charges for texting, calling and data transfer..",You can't beat it for FREE.  You just have to be near a WIFI location to use it.  The one draw back for me is I didn't use it often enough.  After a couple of weeks of none use you lose the dedicated number and your contacts have to learn the new number you get the next time you use the software.
sadness,One Star,Would not let me keep my own phone number
fear,TextMe,Can text but not make calls.can

fear,Received calls from strangers,Deleted app when the number provided to me began receiving calls from complete strangers.  Not for me.
fear,Not actual free texting,It didn't see it say anywhere that you have to buy credits to use the texting feature. I thought as long as there was wifi you could text for free..guess not.
sadness,SNEAK IN charges,slowly but surely getting a little better. i DON'T LIKE THEM STARTING NOW TO CHARGE ME TO KEEP A NO.

anger,sucks,The whole EMOJI ordeal is not even cool.. it doesn't let you use the EMOJI'S it's not even cool :(
anger,Horrible,This app was perfectly fine until the new update yesterday. I had to uninstall it then re-download it yesterday because it was just loading and wouldn't open. Then when I was finally able to login it wouldn't let me send texts. I was thinking something was wrong w/ my tablet but nope After reading these reviews I see everyone is facing the exact same problems. Fix it
sadness,Not really free,They wanted me to earn credits to make phone calls.  Too many ads and I don't have time to answer ads.  This is misleading.
sadness,One Star,I could not send or receive any texts
sadness,I got it to work once. And then after ...,I got it to work once. And then after that I couldn't get it to log in again. Even if my kindle had a full charge.
sadness,One Star,It didn't work on Amazon phone
disgust,I donÕt  like it ,It didnÕt  make s it easy for mom to get  a hold of me
fear,no responses,"No. You can text and call but don't wait for a response. It's like having a one sided conversation. Unless I needed emergency assistance, I will never use this. Deleted from my apps"
fear,No way,IFT is very bad. When ever you want to get free credits and fill out a buncxh of information it doesn't give you and credits at all. Random people have also texted me.very slow too. So I defiantly don't recommend this app because it sucks.
fear,"Free trial, not free text","Scam.  Free for two seconds, then they want a monthly fee to keep the number.  NOT free text.  Just another free trail."
sadness,Text by Kindle,Texting on my Kindle was a way to get through having no phone text access.

disgust,donÕt like it ,Perfect way for Kendal owners to text others. Though there are lots and lots of adds and many times the app kick me out.dont like it 
fear,Number Changed Suddenly - Voicemails from Strangers,"Purchased this app so my daughter could text me and family friends from her Fire tablet. After a few weeks, the number changed with no notice and she began to receive random, strange texts and voicemails from people we dont know. It didnt cost us anything so I cant complain that I wasted money, but the idea that your kids are getting threatening calls intended for the person who had the number before them is more than enough reason to just delete the app. Why would the number change and why is a texting app allowing voicemails?"
disgust,donÕt like it ,HAS PROBLEMS SEEING AND RETAINING PASSWORD INFO. APPEARS ITS STILL BUGGY.donÕt like it 
sadness,Couldn't even get it to load on my son's kindle ...,Couldn't even get it to load on my son's kindle.  We were trying to put it on for him to use at camp.  It was a no go.
sadness,TextMe does deliver as advertised.,Failed to provide free texting  as advertised.
anger,this app sucks. To many ads,"I would give it negative stars.... this app sucks. To many ads, and lags a lot"
sadness,That is not explained on purchase a new credit is given additional fees are charged if you want to cancel month after month,Does not work to verify identity for third-party apps such as Twitter or Instagram
fear,Text,"It works fine, but You can't use your own number.  A phone number is assigned to you.  When people get the text they don't know who you are."
fear,Fire 7 App,Decided against using this service on the Fire 7.
fear,I could only text on it,It was quite difficult to start the operation. It made calld to people I did not know.
sadness,What a piece of crap,"After one txt it wouldn't allow me to do anything more, saying I needed credits Then it gives you a list of what you can do and how many credits you can earn. I went for surveys, cuz you could earn a lot there. I did 3 long ones and should have gotten at least 40 credits. I go back to the program and it says I earned 15 What a piece of crap"
sadness,One Star,"Have no way to send or receive texts, just stay with e-mail"
sadness,mine doesn't work...,"It was the best texting app ever until yesterday. It worked fine but yesterday it stopped sending messages, its either my tablet or the app, and I think its the app, I will rate 5 star if it works again."
sadness,Awful,started off fine. 2 hours in and I stopped recurring texts and could only send them. Videos wouldnt load and when I tried to log back in it told me my info was wrong even though I double checked everything. wouldn't recommend
sadness,videos????,Every time I try to watch videos for credits it doesn't work it automatically switches me to offers  where are the videos for credits
fear,TextMe,donÕt like it it. But all calls aren't free. I have to either but credits to tthem.
fear,My opinion of TextMe,"Difficult to maneuver, difficulty hearing phone calls, texting works greast, phone not so much."
fear,No Instructions.,"Was not clear if it was free or not.  Fear of hidden charges  for me when showing a ""points"" system, along with charges. How confusing  I am on a fixed income and cannot use it if there is a charge."
sadness,couldn't validate me email address..,"Didn't even get started with this. I don't understand how it could email asking me to validate and when I clicked on the link, it sent me a whoops message..."
disgust,donÕt like it ,"When I log in, it says logging in then it goes back to the 'sign in or sign up' screen. Please fix that.donÕt like it "
fear,Slow for me,Its convenient but takes entirely too long to load in my kindle fire. Has to reload every time you go away from the app too.
fear,Cool app but would be better if incoming messages could be heard,On the kindle we cannot hear incoming texts or calls. I am not sure if it is me or just the way it is but its a bummer :(
anger,no,this app is stupid you can't get the credits  byvideo at all
anger,Not Worth the Downloaded Space,You can only make calls to users of this app.I couldn't even sign up it just exited out and said the app foreclosed did it three times so I uninstalled and got a better texting app that lets me create a account. And I'm on my kindle fire HD
sadness,Free,"I didn't like it advertised free but wasn't,  when I tried"
disgust,I don't like all the advertising that pops up,"I don't like all the advertising that pops up. I even hit the botten that is not suppose to let the advertising come through. And it still does. And if someone calls you , you might miss the call. Because the ringing is very low. Not inpressed."
fear,Too intrusive,"This is an unfair review because I never got past the sign in.  I felt the sign in (up) was way too intrusive and then I had to sign up for another phone number.  This seemed a little too much just so I can text with my friends who own Apple products.  This all may be a misunderstanding of how the Fire works.  At this point, I'm ready to spend a little more and get an IPad mini."
anger,Don't waste your time if you have a Kindle,"As usual, amazon store communication apps are worthless. After install, it was erroring out when attempting to create account or login, on my Fire HD 8.9. Restarted the tablet and now the app crashes before even getting to the start screen. It's been about 8 months since I attempted all the text/IM options in amazon app store, and you'd THINK at some point the gaping hole would be noticed. No wonder I've never met or heard of anyone getting a ""fire phone"". I bet they lack communication tools, also."
anger,Scam,To earn a free talk you have do impossible few things
fear,I didn't use it long,The app only works if your contacts use it too. I had one contact who used it with me. So I deleted it.

fear,Not user-friendly,"After downloading the app for my Kindle Fire, I'm pretty disappointed. I am unable to create contacts without using their emails (to ultimately flood them with spam), which I will not do. My son likes to text my family and friends, but it is not very user friendly. I'm going to keep it for now as I don't have many options on the Kindle. When I find a new one, TextMe will be deleted."
sadness,Difficulty handling existing contacts,This app does not recognize existing contacts.  Every attempt to send a text involved sending a separate number .  Poor design feature.

fear,"No clue how to use, no instructions","App had no instructions, no side link that could give you a hint how to use it. Just pick a number for yourself, and that's it. I have no idea how to dial out, or how to select a number to text to.Crap app."
anger,stupid app,This app freaking sucks it won't let me watch videos for more credits
sadness,Four Stars,Don't like that I have to earn credits

anger,TRASH,Is completely  trash :'(  DON'T DOWNLOAD BAD APP
sadness,Seems a pity I can't give it zero stars,"I found this product not only useless, but staggering in its uselessness.  The amount of crapware built into the app is the worst I've ever encountered.  The ""ease of use"" is non-existent, and that comes from a computer professional.  I would be embarrassed to have designed anything this clunky.  And all that might be almost forgivable if it at least let you send simple text messages.  Mine does not.  The basic version I downloaded does not even have the icon you should be able to click on to send a text.At least the price seems about where it should be."

anger,HATE IT?,"I need credits to call people, the friggin point of apps like this was to call people for FREE. Why do I have to complete a survey or buy credits. The video option doesn't even work. I don't & won't recommend it to anyone. STAY AWAY FROM APPS LIKE THESE. You are better off just buying a phone and paying a monthly or yearly bill."

anger,Horrible on Fire Tablet,"The app messes with your keypad, so you end up clicking on ads you didn't intend to, and also typing and deleting characters you didn't intend to. Makes it really clunky and difficult to use. I wish I could rate this higher, but it was such a nightmare for me that I ended up deleting it within minutes."
anger,Don't waste your time,Complete waste of money to buy minutes if you live in Guam. Does not work. Keep trying to call and it rings once or twice then just ends the call. Purchased minutes as well and it does not work. So frustrating

sadness,One Star,it really annoying to get credit to call

sadness,Full of ads. No reason to download this,"Full of ads. If you send a pic, viewer must open a link full of advertising. Don't see the need for this app at all."
anger,Why Bother ???,"It works, but you are bombarded with ads and messages to use it or lose the number. We gave it up... too much drama involved for such a thing."

fear,Not too sure about this one,"Nothing but problems with fire tablet 5th gen. Uses many permissions to your device then if you log out, you cant get back in. I tried several username accounts, each one did the same. Cant log back in. However, when I was inside the text part did work except you cant use your contacts to text. When you click on a contact, all you can do is invite them to use text me. All contacts must be manuallyventered to text. I repeat, this is with a fire hd 10 tablet, I did not test with android phone. Use with caution. I deleted app."

anger,doesnt do its job anymore,"Well, it USED to work, but now, the text button is blocked by an add and the ""get free coins""  thing. As you can tell, it kinda sucks now."
fear,Bummer,Not using it discovered it was not synced with my text messages on iPhone

fear,No phone numbers available,Tried this app. I can't get my own phone number through the app so I can only contact people who have the app. 1 star
fear,I never got this installed correctly that I wasnt using my tablets like that anyway,I believe if I would install this right I could use the tablets are to call my parents and its on my phone as long as Im connected to Wi-Fi
anger,Frustrating,They need to fix their MMS do that your number is recognized as a US Number and other people can text you pictures . Right now every person who texts me gets the same message and it had been researched by developers on the other end to be an issue with the MMS on text me side.  Contacted then mirror times problem is still not fixed. The response was to tell the other people to switch to their app.  Not happening. fucking app
anger,Don' bother,"Downloaded the app and tried to create an account.  It appears as if it will assign you a phone number, but no matter what code I tried, it gave me no numbers from which to choose.  Wasted bandwidth downloading this app."
sadness,error,This app was working fine until a couple days ago. It won't let me send texts anymore. I can still receive them but not send. Super disappointing. Amazon really needs to update to newest version
sadness,Two Stars,"Can't pick up sent photos,can't pick up a tone when text comes in."
fear,Not worth your time,Not free. Needed in a pinch as i forgot my phone. That is why I rarely go to the underground as most all of these are misrepresented in one way or another.
fear,You have to purchase points or watch videos or buy ...,You have to purchase points or watch videos or buy products to use this app. Not what I was expecting. I deleted it.
disgust,WOULD NOT GET IT AGAIN.  NOTHING IS EVERY REALLY FREE,DON'T LIKE HAVING TO BUY ADDITIONAL TIME TO USE.
anger,Worst app,This is the worst texting app I have ever used... I can't even say I used it because it wouldn't let me make a account or sign in with my old one. Don't get this junky app
fear,update please,It won't let me sign in.... I can't get my own phone number through the app so I can only contact people who have the app
disgust,Why do we need credits?,"I don't like the fact that we neee credits to even text. It makes no sense. If you want unlimited text/calls don't use this app, I would've given this a 1 star if I wasn't nice."
anger,Horrible,I used up all my credits and now the only way to get them is to buy them I tried to ask them to give me more but they said no
disgust,App didn't  like ,I never could get into work and also I didnÕt like such type of app . 
fear,Bad for me.,Too intrusive. I can't get my own phone number through the app so I can only contact people who have the app
sadness,The random calls,In the app you get random calls from random people other than that you should get it you just need the app on your electronic and the person you Want to call you just need their number It makes you a number too
disgust,One Star,"STUPID DONT LIKE,  I can't get my own phone number through the app so I can only contact people who have the app"
fear,Update ruined it,"I used to love this app. Since they did update that includes ads all the time, it has become buggy and annoying. About every third message I send, it takes forever and sometimes will never stop saying, ""sending"". I started copying and pasting to try again to send the same message. It usually sends on the third or fourth try. However, as soon as one sends, they all send, even if I deleted the others while they were still sending. So the person I am texting with either gets no text or several of the same text. Absolutely unacceptable for business communication. I would have paid 9 for the app the way it used to be, but I can't see spending one dime if I'm not guaranteed these bugs will go away. Please fix it This was the best app going, before you moneyed with it. I really don't want to have to get a different app and a new phone number."
fear,I'm very disappointed with Amazon,I'm very disappointed with Amazon.When I got this kindle I was able to text my son and all of a sudden that ability has left.

fear,Not free anymore.....,I just started using this app again and I see that you have to have credits now which you didn't have to have before. You either have to invite your friends to use the app or spend money to get more credits. Not cool. I'm deleting this app and going to use another one.
disgust,bleh,I donÕt like it but.......... this person tried to keep calling me even know that I trashed it and she keeps trying to ask me to date even now I'm 13 and my mom and dad won't let me date yet and I wish it didn't need wifi

disgust,Best Texting App on the Kindle,"I  donr loved this app on my iPod, because  now on the Kindle its just as cool, it just needs a little updating to be perfect. The texts don't always appear unless I refresh the texts then they appear. Fix this and then it'll be 5 Stars"

anger,DISSAPOINTMENT,IT'S THE WORRST APP EVER AND IT'S NOT FREEWORST OF ALL IT CANOT SET UP TO WI-FI
fear,Isn't sending texts,"It worked for a little while, but shortly after it wouldn't send my texts to a few people."
fear,not easy to set up or use,I actually removed from my device.  Was not what I expected.  I would have to others set up an account using this app.
fear,"Horrible, I cant talk to nobody :(","It loads super slow, ads pop up ALL THE TIME. You need credits to call, and now it doesnt let you send messages past a certain point. I cant talk to my friends now, text or call. Do NOT get this app, its trash.Btw,it crashes all the time now."
anger,Why your app is a fail,"First off, I was using your app before the stupid update. I was thinking about purchasing a plan because the number was fully integrated into my life. Here's why I didn't and why I now HATE this app.1. You are trying to Bully people into going premium. I just tried to have a conversation with my family. I got 26 FREAKING ADS AND POP UPS. I was sent to my browser 13 times. Why? What purpose does that serve other than to Piss potential customers off.2. You are TRICKING people into clicking your links. When I press send it takes a few seconds and while my finger is hovering over I press the Ad. I know this because I did it 13 FREAKING Times in one conversation.3. Your App sends messages to the wrong person. You'll be in the middle of typing a message to someone and who you have selected changes before you can press send...because it keeps refreshing BECAUSE OF THE STUPID ADS. There is an Ad per 3 messages in my last conversation.So, you're losing a customer because you're so eager to make a few dimes off of ads I was NEVER GOING TO CLICK. I was going to buy credits but now you guys are so slimy I wouldn't even trust you with my bank info"
fear,not with kindle,not knowing more about how the app worked i tried it.the only way this app works is if your friends also has the app.I say you need more information in order to know if it will work for you
fear,To many jumping ads make big hassle,"First of all, it does work. PROBLEM the ads are really a hassle.  They put the ads in the way, jump them around so you accidentally click the ads while trying to use the app. So its a little bit the scam.The price to remove ads?  Outrageous  10 a month???  I would pay 10 once or 10 a year."
fear,"It's not free, like it stated.","It's not free, like it stated. It let me send two text messages before they wanted payment."
fear,Crap,The app is crap if you talk to the text me app
sadness,Scam,I had a very important text that it my boss was sending for me so I was not allowed to read it only if I lot for the membership I was so upset then just going the same text over and over again the same text I would get random calls this is why take your risk when down loading this appFree app not so much
anger,Hate,I hate text me it glitches and it doesn't do anything I want to not get it
disgust,donÕt Love it,I donÕt  love this app . You cant talk to your friends and family
sadness,Kindle,"Didn't work on my kindle, I could not send text or receive text.  I've tried many and this is not one I'd try again."

fear,"Someone stole my son's Kindle, I turned on a ...","Someone stole my son's Kindle, I turned on a locator and never pinged after I saw this was ordered. Please find it"
sadness,Just not my cup of tea,I needed this in a pinch when my business phone went down. It appeared anyone who you need to text needed to get the app as well. I deleted it immediately.
fear,Sandijeans,"This application  is only  fair, calls are not always clear. Can't delete contacts from contact list, and when I dial my husband's phone it comes up Amazon Marketplace. It is frustrating I have even upgraded thinking I would get better service but it only got worse. Really am thinking of switching..."
anger,The worst,The worst frecking app u need an email? Ha this app is a piece of frecking trash
sadness,Doesn't work,Ugh all I wanted was a txt app but I have to be 13 and I put in my email and it said this account already existed with this email. What? Like why?
anger,Crashed immediately,". I got a virus on my ipad. And it got my email and id almost stolen I hate it and I recommend you not to download it and not be an idiot, like me."
fear,Worked Well Until A Couple Days Ago,"I have used this app on my kindle for a while now, over a year at least. But like two days ago, it started to cause pop-up ads in my browser. And it spams them, almost the way a computer virus would. And in case you're thinking it's not the program but is REALLY a virus, it only happens when I have this app open. Which means it is attached to this app in some way, shape, or form. If they would remove whatever is causing this, this review would've been a lot higher."
sadness,Won't work,Download from Amazon and you can't add contacts. Download it from play store and then you can't sign in to the app on your kindle.
anger,This app sucks,This app sucks. When some calls you... It doesn't even let you answer the phone. It is just a blank black screen. When the call hangs up then that's when the app takes you to the call. It's so annoying. When you press the app to go on it. It may go straight to the app... But most times it takes you back to the home screen. It may just the tablet but it could also be the phone to o. I'm sick of it
anger,Not helpful at all,This is one of the worst app ever it won't let me sign in plus when it would let sign in the people I was texting wouldn't let the person revive it and yes I was using WiFi
fear,READ,I only put a 3 star is because In order to call or text  you have to have the person email address and I don't know if sends because my friend hasn't texted me back so ya it says it sends but I don't think so.
disgust,I donÕt  love it,I donÕt love it  because  I can't save contacts and also cant send messages

fear,It is a trick,Do Not by this app for a free number. It is no use. You will go on a trip with no electronics. It will cancel your number and the only way to get it back is by paying for a membership. Don't waste your time you are going to get scammed.
anger,Bull,I got an email this afternoon at 4:30 saying I had to use my number or else I would lose it. Not even 4 hours later I go to use it and its gone Ridiculous... Doesn't even give you a chance to do anything.

anger,"Terrible app, terrible company.","This app is incredibly glitchy. It crashes all the time. Half the time it won't pop up a notification or the chathead when those options are turned on. And now, during a global pandemic, they feel it's the right time to go pay-only. It's not like people who aren't getting paid during this crisis need to communicate at all.  Jerks."
fear,Rlly?,"I Can't text anyone, when I put in the number it shows for 1 sec and then disappears I Can't text ANYONE"

sadness,not working,"I love the app but it isn't letting me text my best friend anymore, please fix it "
fear,BEWARE,As soon as I said NO on selling my info...this app failed. BE AWARE.
sadness,Not user friendly,"Way too many ads in the middle of a conversion, and no help in trying to set up contacts.  You have to just kind of figure out out yourself.  Oh, and did I mention WAY TOO MANY ADS?"
anger,I'm not stupid i promise,I'm not stupid but I can't figure out how to face time or make someone a contact
anger,Too Stupid to Understand ANY Of This Tablet,"Once I downloaded TextMe, I can only use it by paying 4.99/week or 8.99/month. What's free??? I cannotput anyone's name, let alone ones mobile number norhome number or address. It's totally useless for me Iwonder if it has to do with my receptive processingdisorder.  I miss out on practically everything I attemptand fail at.  Sick of it Two days later, I find they're charging me 59/ month. I'd sue, but I have clue how to. That's how they get away with it.  Such BS"
fear,Disappointed,The app let me call n message for a day. Than stop now it say all my message failed I can't call out. I have no clue if that person trying to message me. Disappointed
disgust,Haven't used it much but...,I was surprised that there was an app you could get on an Amazon Fire that could send and receive messages with ios devices. I have read other reviews and it said that you would have to pay for calls and texts the more you use it. I don't like the pop up ads.
fear,Acts like a virus,It worked fine until recently but now will spam pop-up ads.
sadness,Done,It will not load Get it fix now or I'm deleting It's stupid You guys should have already fixed this I've sent many reviews and this is my limit

fear,Bewer of ads,It pops out every time.This is amazing you can text and call the downsides are the speaker doesn't work you can't face time unless you and that person have the app and you get calls later then they call you but has everything I need
anger,I do not recommend.,"Very buggy, keeps shutting down.  Sometimes people don't get your text or you don't get their text.  Very frustrating.  I started using a different text app.  Plus the ads use a lot of your data."
anger,Annoying,Three stars because the ads are so freaking annoying They are always getting in the way
sadness,average,"It's a pretty decent app, but I hate how the group chats don't work very well"
fear,They commit fraud with a straight face,This is the worst app Ive ever had the misfortune of downloading and paying for. The minute I had trouble logging on they deleted my account for unusual activity a cost me thousands of dollars as a result of lost contacts in business I have cultivated. Beware the terms of use agreement they use this as an excuse to Kohn and defraud you have your money do not I repeat do not use this app they are frauds and cons
anger,Useless for me,"This app is terribke.  I have tried to connect it 3 times.  It tells me my email is invalid.  It won't let me use my cell phone .  When I try to log in, I tell it I need a new password.  It then it asks me for my email then tells me it is invalid.  It has assigned me a number to use instead of using my number.  I can't correct not edit my information.  Totally useless"
sadness,Doesn't work on Kindle Fire 10 HD,"It let me download it via this app store, let me create an account and pick a number... but then just sits on a blue screen with the TextMe logo. There's no way to do anything."
anger,Piece of crap,"Well sure, it works. That's about it. 1. The app is so slow it doesn't even open half the time. 2. It doesn't let you do anything until it's loaded its ads. 3. Notifications are shoddy at best, sometimes sending 6 or 7 for one text. 4. Unable to name my conversations after the latest update. Absolute trash app."
sadness,What?,I thought it would let me sync my phone and tablet with the same number but it gave you a new one and made you make an account? How sad 
sadness,Tried to set up an account for my daughter. ...,"Tried to set up an account for my daughter. When we went back to log in, it just goes back to the start up page and will not log in. Have tried reinstalling and resetting the password. She was excited to have a texting app on her Kindle Fire because she does not have a phone, but every one we try to download doesn't seem to work. Very frustrating for me and disappointing for her."
fear,I hate the last up date,I have always loved this app until the last update I have not been able to text anyone
fear,Needs Kindle support,Advertised at Kindle Store but support topics don't apply.  My first simple problem is adding contacts and the help options do not mention Kindle Fire.  I am getting the nothing I paid so far
fear,Scamming app,"Scammers are using this app. I listed a car for sale on Craigslist and I I have been greeting text scams from different numbers and when I call them back, I get the you have reached your friend on text me. And so forthText me needs to put some security in its app or every legitamate consumer that uses it is in danger of scamming"
fear,It's a SWINDLE,"After proclaiming at every point in their descriptions that you can TEXT COST-FREE [""Free Texting (real SMS messages) to any Phone number in the United States, Canada, and 40 countries.""], the app wants me to furnish 5 credits for any and every SMS I try to send. All this FROM the US-based number they assigned me (213-375-xxxx) TO several other US numbers I attempted to text to.There are plenty of other user-interface glitches which I will not waste time on describing -- I am not a beta tester working for free The app will be expunged from my Kindle Fire within a minute from now."
fear,not user friendly,not easy to understand and i didnt trust it.My first simple problem is adding contacts and the help options do not mention Kindle Fire.  I am getting the nothing I paid so far
anger,This sucks not what I thought it would be,I didn't even get to log in because it loads way to slow and I heard that you can only make calls  a few times in a month so not get this app it sucks

fear,Alright but....,"Whenever someone text me back, its a voicemail and notAn actually text message."
anger,Terrible,"The problem started with my account not being able to receive calls. I created a  phone number with the app for my company, big mistake. I placed the number on the website and all over signs across the city. I was unable to receive calls and it slowed down my business completely. I was unable to contact anyone at the company. I emailed over ten times and continued to receive a generic reply. If your going to use this company for anything serious I suggest you stay far away. Cost  me so much money and time.."

fear,Short on Options but it works,"I don't have a smart phone of any kind, but I do have a kindle fire tablet.  I am using this on my tablet and it seems to be working for me as long as I am at home near my wi fi. It seems very light on options such as putting a name to the people I get texts from for easy identification.

anger,It is awful,"I downloaded this app on my tablet for my brother I texted my phone and now my phone won't pick up service and is very slow I think it did something to my phone because it was fine before. I am working on trying to get the ""virus/bug"" off my phone ."

disgust,One Star,Did not like it. Because it have a lot of ads.
fear,It is becoming increasingly harder to win,"I have been playing this game for several years and have weathered several iterations of the game. Although recently I have toyed with the idea of not playing any more. It is becoming increasingly difficult to win either the bonus rounds or the regular play. Which makes it not so much fun anymore. I used to play on an Android product. I was somewhere in the levels between 90 and 100. When my tablet blew up I switched to playing on my Kindle Fire tablet. It doesn't have the advantages of watching ads and earning jewels which the Android had. And I had to start over with level one. I'm now in level 44 and it has taken over a year to get there. Granted, I don't play all day long: I play in the morning before work and at night before bed. But that's always been true. But, as I said, it's getting harder and harder to win just a regular round."

Support is of no help they just keep sending you nonsense emails
fear,Buggy?,Showed promise as being a potentially enjoyable game but...played a few rounds then the game persistently stuck at one point in a game. Couln't get past it. Deleted it.
fear,It's annoying with it's tutorials throughout,"You can only play for 5 minutes before it asks you to pay if you want to play more... not worth the free version. Buy it? No, not worth that either. It's annoying with it's tutorials throughout. And you can't turn off the noise either."
sadness,Sad,"I like it lots but lately keeps kicking me off, I load it, push  to play, kicks me off. Over and over. I think I'll give up."
fear,Frustrating,1. The game has frozen and made itself impossible to keep all the progress.2.  Wish that there many more ways to use or gain gems to play3. Wish that there were more assistance for finishing levels.4.  Customer service is efficient however there should be a way to get personal help after more than three or four email exchanges still does not solve the issue.
anger,crashes,I think I might like this game but it crashes so many times I get frustrated. Too bad...seems like it would be fun.

fear,Very hard game.,It takes too long to win the items that are needed. The levels move very slowly.
anger,One Star,"Too confusing what the fuck is this bro , update it "
fear,Interesting but frustrating,It is not easy to climb through the levels. I refuse to make purchases in order to advance.  I finally became too frustrated to continue.  I uninstalled the game.
anger,One Star,"Poor and Too confusing what the fuck is this bro , update"
anger,I hate it,I hate it it kept popping up on my screen and can't go anywhere
disgust,Game,"Did not like.  Erased.Too confusing what the fuck is this bro , update"
disgust,Three Stars,I don't like free games where you can't play continually without having to buy coins or whatever.
disgust,One Star,Did not like. No instructions on how to play the game
disgust,Disappointed,Didnt like at all. Confusing and disappointing
disgust,Don't force a purchase,I don't like that you're kinda forced to buy jewels and things in order to to gain items you need as a quest.
fear,... spend  on inside items you will get quickly bored.,Unless you want to spend  on inside items you will get quickly bored.
fear,Dreadfully Boring,"I think this is one of the worst versions of this game genre I have ever played. Slow ,  unimaginative, repetitive crappy game, story, graphics. Unless you are willing to play this game until your retirement, run ,don't walk away from this game. Not worth it.Did I mention boring ? Consider yourself warned."
fear,Grew not to like it,"It was kind of confusing, and I couldn't afford to buy time to win a game,, so soon got tired of dealing with it and deleted it"
fear,Touch screen mistakes,Watch out for the mistakes you can make in the game because of the touch screen. Can mess up your strategy.
fear,Some complaints,The game is aot of fun other then the slow drop rate on some of the items needed to finish collections.
sadness,Disappointed,"It would be a very fun game if I didn't have trouble with clicking on things. The game would freeze whenever I tried to click on something, then it would unfreeze and it was not my computer it was the game. So I ended up uninstalling it."
fear,Not for kids,Too hard for younger children. My 8 year old grandson got so frustrated he won't play it anymore.
fear,Lost all levels and  from 2 years of playing,Over 2 years gone .... I reinstalled and it went back to first level. Lost all my levels and  I spent .... needless to say you guys royally upset me. If I don't get reimbursed up to my levels....will never play your games again

sadness,Didn't work,Couldn't get it to work on my tablet. Had to erase it
fear,afraid iof it ,Fun at challenging enough to keep intersting.  frustrating when rewards aren't really under the tile.afraid of it bro
fear,Bummer,If you like to play games where you don't win then this is for you. I don't play anymore.
fear,Energy takes too long,"I enjoy the game, but it takes too long to recover energy.  It is also tiresome playing the same games so many times before getting the items you need."
fear,Need help,Trying to update my kindle fire for game and it says for android only. What's the deal??
anger,It requires money to play when you go shopping.  It is not free,"I hate this game and want to delete it from my device.  The game at first seemed innocent enough, then all of a sudden I didn't understand what I was doing and I got into shopping;  that's when the program changed and I realized it was like a casino game where I was getting real money.  I got out of that quick  Even the music on this game sounds evil  I don't like it at all "
fear,"limited game play unless you buy ""energy"" Too bad","Decent game but very transparent in effort to get you to spend real . Constant ""sales"" and ""offers"", limited game play unless  you buy ""energy"" Too bad"
fear,confusing,It's fun but a bit confusing.  Half the time I am not sure I even know what I am doing. It keeps telling me to play levels that I have already played and gotten three stars on.
fear,Frustrating,"Match 3 is challenging and entertaining. However, it takes an extremely LONG TIME  for credits to build up so play can continue. It also takes a ridiculous amount of plays to obtain needed objects in order to progress up the levels. It seems obvious that the ENTIRE intention is to get players to spend more and more ""real"" money. I have hundreds of thousands of ""play"" money and resources, that seems to be of no value what so ever.  Extremely frustrating Don't waste your"
anger,Waste of time,Too much nonsense going on that interferes with the actual game.  Waste of time.
fear,Keeps asking me to spend money. Hahaha.,"Played it a lot. Kind of a pain since I refuse to spend any money makes the game slower, more difficult to enjoy and possibly impossible to really succeed in it. Finally got tired and put it aside."
fear,"fun, but too much repetition","This is a fun game, but there are way too many challenges introduced, each which take way too many components to complete. If they cut these down to a third, it would be more challenging. They way it is now, there isn't much that makes you want to complete a challenge, because there are 20 more going on at the same time."
sadness,Ordered an other game and this was game was sent to my kindle,order was a mistake.Does not work. Hard to figure out the app.
fear,"Graphics are nice, but the tedious way you have to maneuver ...","Sorry, not a fan  Too complicated and ""costly"" for new energy and moving up levels.  Graphics are nice, but the tedious way you have to maneuver through it all...  Not my type of game."
fear,fun but pricey,"Fun, but each level costs a lot of energy to play, much more so than other games. Makes me lose interest quickly."
anger,too costly after downloaded,"Although well planned and crafted, the problem arises when you try to make much progress. It can't be done without spending a lot of real money. When I get to that point, I am deleting what could have been one of the most enjoyable games I've been able to find. It's a pity."
anger,Instructions get in the way,"It simply will not let you just play, your only option is to make the move it shows you. So aggravating, I deleted it after 10 minutes."
fear,now what.,Was playing last night almost finished level 36  game crashed haven't been able to get back on.

fear,One Star,Free? Not really. App keeps asking you to buy things.
fear,Warning,I've been playing this game for 2 yrs and I use to love it however now its really slow and expensive . If u buy a pack for 19.99 wait a few months to purchase again they roll out something new and bigger every other day anymore.  So no point in spending more then needed all the stuff u will think ur missing out on will be included in the next purchase u make no matter how long u wait.
fear,Never again,A game that will take money like no tomorrow. Very addictive with no ending. Takes and takes but never gives back. After four years of it. I had enough and got sick of what Ive spent on the game. Total embarrassment once I finally realized.

fear,One Star,Didn't order this or download it again my brothers downloaded a game I don't play this sorry

fear,The App was advertised as free.... ...,The App was advertised as free.... but all it does is try to sell you upgrades every step of the way...
disgust,its game of war,"It's game of war just re-skinned, it functions exactly I donÕt  like it.  Also it's one of the biggest money sponges out there.  You will spend thousands to level up.  No exaggeration on the dollar amount."
anger,Money Hole,Get ready to hate your bank account all over again.
anger,Copy,"It's a copy of Game Of War. Enough said, please don't download this. It's a waste."
disgust,Fun if you like strategy games but only if your rich,It was fun at first but the only way to keep it fun is spend thousands of dollars. They come out with new stuff every week and you can't keep up unless you spend lots of money. Creators are geniuses.
disgust,0 Star,I thought it would be fun but the second time I played it it would not let me play
disgust,One Star,Boring There's nothing that differentiate it from others in the same category
disgust,Tiedious,"No fun, feels like a job keeping up on all the actions and building."
disgust,no Fun game,"  I want  to fuck them alll , Their  are not greed for money making it useless to play.  It is not  fun combat game too.  But you have to spend money to compete. Fuck "
disgust,"Stay away, it will literally cost thousands of dollars ...","Stay away, it will literally cost thousands of dollars to be anything but a victim of big spenders, a total money pit..30 k in a year to even be relevant. No exaggeration, I am speaking from actual experience... What a fool I was stay far away from this game."
disgust,"Fun, but unusable on the kindle fire platform.","Very fun game, but it costs a lot of money and now crashes constantly on my kindle fire.  It now crashes every couple of minutes and I really can no longer recommend it on Amazon's platform."
disgust,"Terrible customer service, glitches and many updates","This game user to be very fun. Unless you spend several hundred dollars a week you can't compete. New releases several times a week now. Sure, it's free to download but 10k after you get sucked in. Yes I said 10,000.000."
disgust,One way ticket to Hell,"If you like to spend a bunch of money on an app that barely functions, then this game is for you  Constant pressure to buy through pop ups, spammy mails, and ""blogs"" that are really just ways to talk about buying more stuff.  Put that together with an unstable app that frequently freezes, crashes, glitches, and just generally sucks and you've got Mobile Strike."
disgust,the problem with me is that when i made a ...,"the problem with me is that when i made a purchase and the system stated that there was a problem with the purchase and that an E-mail will fallow. well the E-mail did fallow but it stated that  I made a purchase , and that all. well I never received the items and I tried on some occasions several times when I received the notice that there was a problem, thinking that maybe it was a WIFY  problem. when I finally received the credit card statement my card had gone past it limits. So be very carefull with these games cause they will keep charging you even if you do not receiv your items. Keep a record of your purchases and specially your"" OOOOPS there is a problem with your purchase"""
disgust,One Star,Don't really care for the game. No direction in what to do. Upgrade upgrade upgrade for what?
disgust,Needs more,"Exactly the same as Game of War, but without mythical creatures.Could use more interesting landscape, and more uniqueness in features. When I played it I thought I had accidentally opened GOW."
disgust,This popped up on my 4 year olds tablet and ...,This popped up on my 4 year olds tablet and he purchased it. I deleted it right away as its inappropriate for his age.
disgust,One Star,It's just a way to ask for more money while you play the game.
disgust,Expensive to play. The continuing to expand the game ...,Expensive to play.  The continuing to expand the game and charge a lot for upgrades.  Not for kids without a bank account.  It's an adult game that is complex.
disgust,Takes forever to load,This game seems really cool and fun to play based on the advertisements. But really it just takes about a quarter of your data and is stuck in loading position. I advise you to download another game.
disgust,Money Grab for Dying Company,"Terrible game. Want to play at all? 100 a week. Want to play as a mid level leader? 300 a week. Want to lead an alliance and compete for the main events in game? 1000 a week. What do they do with all that money, you ask. To be honest, I have no idea. The game is laggy, crashes all the time both on Android and IOS. The servers they use have no way to keep up with even slightly above normal activity. The games creator, Epic War LLC is currently tied up in legal battles and this game is simply a money grab in an attempt to pay for the court costs and pad their pockets and give them a parachute for once they inevitably have to pay out a settlement. Do yourself a favor and don't play this game unless you have about 30,000 - 50,000 per year to spend on it."
disgust,One Star,Just another pay for play.  GRaphics are the same as everywhere.  What we need is a truly global game.
disgust,Money pit,"Stay away from purchasing ANYTHING.... you constantly competing against people who spend thousands of dollars on the game... and in order to keep up, you must spend more then anyone else monthly. Played the game for about 3 months... spent over 2K. regret the decision."
disgust,BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE,"Ripoff, don't waste your money playing this game. New enhancements are released 2-3 times a week and will require 1000-3000 to complete them, if you don't spend in this game, you have ZERO chance of competing."
disgust,FALSE ADVERTISING TELL US THE TRUTH Don't waste my time,"It would be refreshing if we were told the truth or at least to not be mis-led by claims of ""FREE APP"", only to find that after going to the trouble of downloading this monstrosity of a program, that in fact, no, first we're going to need the following: access to all your personal info, your social media accounts, your contacts, a CC on file for all the tools and upgrades we know you're going to want/need in order to play this ridiculous thing Thanks, but no thanks I'm out"
disgust,... rest All nosense talk very little credible Actoun Don't waste your,Waist of money  read about half and junked the restAll nosense talk very little credible Actoun Don't waste your time
disgust,Waste of money,Play at your own risk and like has been mentioned before to be relevant and not be the ones getting crushed it will cost you more money than you want to know. Don't put your money into this game you will end up disappointed unless throwing thousands away to win doesn't bother you.
disgust,Laggy,This game is very laggy on kindle. Keeps saying please install the app store.. which is installed.. please update this app for kindle. Fun game when the app stays running.
disgust,copy game,Same as game of war except everything costs more....
disgust,I donÕt like and  enjoy it and let you in on a secret,Im a 50 year old newbie at playing games. So I play this on my Kindle 2015. and  I donÕt  enjoy it and let you in on a secret.  Im practicing so I can beat my grandson LOL.
disgust,expensive and a gamble.,"I donÕt like this game, game lags very bad during special event. Building gear is sort of a gamble since the packs give you mostly the same stuff which is useless."
disgust,pure money game,It is a pure money game  If you want to be even remotely competetive it will cost you hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
disgust,lousey  game,hated it the app is always trying to get you to purchase coins to advance. got rid of it fast
disgust,Just way too slow. Takes too long to allow ...,Just way too slow. Takes too long to allow to build your base up. Essentially forces you to buy in game purchases to play at any competitive level.
disgust,One Star,It no fun anymore it's all about the money to them
disgust,Players can't compete,"This game has gotten out of hand with their packs. It is beginning to be a struggle with the few wealthy players. My advice is if you don't have , this game isn't for you."
disgust,Cost too much,"Way to slow to build up unless you pay lots of money. Fuck this game bro , "
disgust,Too Dependent on In-App Purchases For Winning,My teenage sons love the concept of this game and found it easy to play but hated the need to pay for upgrades in the app in order to win.
disgust,Unable to update/download,"I had the version before the update, now it will not update and allow me to play. Fix the issue"
disgust,Nothing free about the game,Ive been playing over a Year MS has gotten greedy constant upgrades everyday at sometimes  they need to go back to what it was a year ago once a week with the constant upgrades there are less targets becoming more like a farmville game currently the hospitals to attack ratio is messed up that all you do is wound troops instead of kill troops
disgust,Just a money trap,"Too many updates to ever keep up.  Have to spend a significant amount of money (literally thousands of dollars) in order to keep up with everything and actually be able to play the majority of the game.  It is fun to build everything up, but any time you unshield, you get killed instantly"
disgust,I can't enjoy the game anymore,Ran by greed. I can't enjoy the game anymore. It's been overly complicated by its programmers. I don't recommend.
disgust,This game is trash.,This is absolutely the worst pay to play game I have ever attempted to play. If you do not plan to spend massive amounts of money this is not a game for you. All the paying players constantly attack you so there is no hope of progressing in this game. I would have given it a -10 star rating if that was possible.
disgust,Two Stars,too much trouble to play...should be ashamed Arnold
disgust,Do not waste your time,"Game sucks. That is all. SUCKS. no point. Nothing. Just boring ass suckery. It is just bad. Don't even want to give one star, but I had to. Blahhhhh. No fricking point"
disgust,Server,Fun to play except. Server gets really slow at times when doing missions or kicks you off and the game reboots.
disgust,One Star,I just dont like strategies. and in advers there  was performed as shooter :(
disgust,I will not invest any real money into playing a game like this so I will never get anywhere,I am not a big fan of these games. While you're trying to learn theres always someone who has tons of money and equipment out there who can make your life miserable. I will not invest any real money into playing a game like this so I will never get anywhere.
disgust,"Fun game, but...","I enjoy the game a lot, but I do have 2 issues. The ridiculous wait times for building/researching/etc, and the constant offers to get you to purchase something.  If you can get around that, then give it a shot"
disgust,poor performance on my kindle fire,tried to play around with it and learn what to do.but app was very slow and buttons didnt work that well :(
disgust,Money pit,"You can't imagine how much of a money pit this game is. You can't get anywhere in the game unless you spend thousands. Yes, I said thousands."
disgust,Horrible game,Constant server crashes if you aren't ready to spend 100 a week do teven bother yourself just be zeroed and have no fun at all
disgust,Can't enjoy the game u less you spend lots of money,Can't enjoy the game u less you spend lots of money. This game is made so that you have to buy packs in order to be a contender and enjoy playing the game otherwise you will lose due to having weak power.
disgust,Ridiculous,Items obsolete in days and way too expensive.  Game glitches constantly and I get booted all the time.  Game monitors state chat and deletes my messages.  No customer service. Complete waste of my hard earned money.
disgust,No don't get,Sucks don't get because it's laggy and ads and all that so DONT GET IT PPL
disgust,Complete lack of enjoyment,"This &34;game&34; is a discouraging waste of time. After 3 months of constant grinding I think that it is fair to present this review. Having read multiple reviews from other players I know that my experience is not unique but very common. Each state is governed by the players that cheat the most and spend the most money. The only way to succeed is to spend more money than the other players, or hack the game for items that would cost money. The culminating purpose of the game is to have each state work together to beat out other states in point challenges. However the petty power bullies refuse to allow any smaller players the opportunity to fully engage in the challenges by utterly destroying their base. Wish I never downloaded it. Glad I never spent money on it. Oh, yeah The big power players try to muscle and intimidate other players into spending money to pay them for protection, like the Mafia. And customer service actually ENDORSES THIS BEHAVIOR"
disgust,This is the most horrible game. It's the same exact game as game ...,"This is the most horrible game. It's the same exact game as game of war but a more modern version. You can't grow without spending hundreds and thousands of dollars. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
disgust,meh,Ad riddled time sink with no entertainment value. it's a worse clash of clans and I only sorta liked clash of clans.
disgust,Stay away from this game it's a money pit like everything else on mobile phones like really stay far ...,Stay away from this game it's a money pit like everything else on mobile phones like really stay far away don't ever come here
disgust,"don't waste your time, its just a fancy comercial",Probably the most bring and slow game I've ever experienced.  Absolutely nothing to do except follow the script.  Not even any animation to watch the battles and raids that you wait so patently for...just a math calculation and a result.  Yawn.
disgust,don't download,Is game is a copied version of a different game and you have to be rich to play it charges you like crazy just to play and it gave my tablet a virus maybe multiple don't bet this infected abomination
disgust,Don't be left hanging,"The issue I have with this game is feedback is very slow. I recently sent in feedback regarding not receiving in-game purchase items. Two days so far no response. We will see were it goes. Many player have complain about using Amazon coin for in-game purchases being very slow to be process taking a better part of a week. So if you want it now, don't uses Amazon coin to make purchases. If you don't mind waiting a few days then you'll be golden, no pun intended."
disgust,Bad,They tell you it's free but want you to pay to play
disgust,Haven't taken the time to play,Basically I don't like it because I haven't set down and played it yet.
disgust,Three Stars,Grand kids I'm sure they donÕt  likes this....... Because they need good layout but the layout of the app is not beautifull dude
disgust,HORRIBLE,"This game used to be fun and then the developers got greedy a few years ago and a huge amount of players left.  Things got a bit better for a few months and now back to being greedy again.  Releasing something new every day started again like it did a few years ago.  Want to keep up? Drop 100 per pack multi times a week.  HORRIBLE stay away from this game unless you want to drop over 10,000 like some players have."
disgust, donÕt Like it,"For the most part...would  donÕt like it more if I could get a break from all the pop ups for deals all the time... maybe even pay for an option to get rid of them (would never happen, but one can dream)."
disgust,Nice game but they just started to ask for location ...,Nice game but they just started to ask for location information everytime I start the game.  There is NO reason for them and I will not accept it.
disgust,"Do not have this App any more, I delete ...","Do not have this App any more, I delete it, because it kept frozen every time I start playing it."
disgust,Sucks,"Ugh, where do I start, the game can get very boring at times, and if you want to have any fun in the game, you have to own a oil plant because everything is super expensive. And, get this, I was on vacation for a few months and when I got back, not only did I get a welcome back gift, but the gift gave me stuff it could take years to get. The game is too easy, hell writing your first sentence is harder than this. You get notifications of the wazoo in this game. And to top it all off, it takes way too much space If you want a game that sucks and boring, then this game is perfect for you"
disgust,Do not spend on this game,The game was fun and than the glitches started. The support staff is unresponsive. The lack of response makes you wonder if they have more than one person working there. Please learn from my mistake do not waste your money on this game. Total rip off. fuck them all 
disgust,Forget it.,"Pretty lame.  Crashes, no challenges.  Just one non-adventure after another."
disgust,Don't like it,E4K is waaaay better. Played for 20 minutes and felt like i was in hell or some kind of dungeon.
disgust,Needs better ever thing,A lot of things need an update and more that's why one star
disgust,"Advertised as ""free"" but you need to constantly add features ...","Advertised as ""free"" but you need to constantly add features at 4.99 each. Deceptive practice. If it's free, it should be free. Plain, simple, direct."
disgust,Irritating game play,"I just reinstalled this game to write this review and I will remove it when I finish.I got Mobil Strike as a easy enjoyable game which I appraoaced as a non cash player. So, I made lvl 14 and was going to keep playing but the game has become really unstable. It crashes after one or two actions. Can't find the app store or just goes away. Not relaxing, not for me any more....gone."
disgust,dumb game,Dumb game won't load and you'll speed all your money on it
disgust,"Pop ups, pop ups everywhere","Let's start with the beginning, so one goes to open the app (simple enough) and this part works you can get into the have you downloaded YAYYY but not  without twenty pop up adds saying ""commander a special sale is being held just for you"" or some other bogus line like that. And everything makes you pay actual money, in short  use your hard earned money somewhere else"
disgust,Money trap,"Fun at first and very addictive.  However, the game quickly become expensive if you want to be competitive at all. Be prepared to spend thousands. As soon as you think you are finished researching and upgrading, the game creators will release more items that you need to buy with money. This cycle never ends.  Not recommended."
disgust,Do not play this game,This is just a money grab. Also horrible performance and constant issues.
disgust,"I have a small fortune invested, and developers continue ...","I have a small fortune invested, and developers continue to dump content on us that makes our investing pointless. After a year and a half,I shielded my account and stopped spending."
disgust,Better have deep pockets to play this,Horrible horrible game. Got to spend a small fortune to level everything up in this game Seems like everything that is needed is only sold in packs Not ideal for casual playing. Would not recommend to anyone. Save your wallet and your time
disgust,Update every three seconds/chrashes all the time,It always needs an update and crashes every minute
disgust,If you like spending hours clicking buttons after spending hundreds of dollars ...,"Only because it won't let me give zero stars. If you like spending hours clicking buttons after spending hundreds of dollars to be competitive, only to be outspent by someone with more money? Then this game is still garbage and you need a new hobby. I quit."
disgust,Really a pay to play game,Be prepared to spend money if you want to advance much.
disgust,Do Not Play,They rip you off. Too many glitches and you spend way too much money.  I am through with this game.
disgust,"Want to play ""Game of War"" with different pictures?","Exact same game as ""Game of War: Fire Age"" with only different pictures.  EXACT same game.  Boring, unimaginative, and excruciatingly slow."
disgust,Updates,I donÕt  love the game because  it will not update  I have had a pending update for weeks now and it will not load  Fix this please
disgust,Super laggy,"Although this game is fun, it lags too much and whenever I click something it doesn't process it until like 10 seconds later. Also crashes once or twice every hour."
disgust,Wast of money,No support money hungry jerks stay away from game unless you want to blow thousands of dollars
disgust,Too much ,"Way to high of prices for a shot at winning at a  ""free"" game. 99 bucks a pack is ridiculous."
disgust,horibale,This game sucks do not get it unless you want to waste your time. I would not get it.
disgust,by then base is destryed and money wasted.,"There is no live support, spent tons of money and have log in problems and have to email for help, by then base is destryed and money wasted."
disgust,One Star,Impossible to install due to bloat ware this is the reason that I donÕt like this stupid game 
disgust,I  donÕt love this game,"I  donÕt love this game because  after buyong coins and trying to open the game to purchase something, it wont let me load the game. Says I need a better internet connection when my connection is perfectly fine... WTF??"
disgust,Would give anything to get my money back,"This ""game"" is nothing short of robbery DO NOT get this game unless you've got money growing on trees Basically it is full of glitches, constantly crashes, and you can never grow in the game to actually compete unless you can spend 100 bucks every couple of days Definitely NOT FREE The developers constantly want you to pay to play but never fix any issues and most definitely are not helpful when you reach out to them I'm ashamed I spent my hard earned money, would like to have it back"
fear,worst game ever out of all games in the world,The tutorial is never ending all you do in the tutorial is upgrade
sadness,fix the amazon crashing for it.,FIX THE CRASHING BUGS OR STATE 62 WILL NO LONGER BUY PACKSIf y'all want me to buy more 99.99 packs I want the game to stop crashing it crashes more then we get to play.
fear,"too expensive, too many glitches not worth playing anymore.","I used to enjoy playing this gamr, back when updates occupied every few months until the in App purchases required to stay relevant and successful dropped to a few days. This game now requires a ridiculous amount of money to play this game and is fraught with glitches that no longer seem to be getting fixed. A year ago I would recommend this game but now? Unless you can afford 500 a week to keep up with new research and upgrades.Bottom line, this game is not worth the amount of money required to play this game"
fear,FREEMIUM. IS. DEAD.,"This game, among any other ""freemium"" titles cost. Your free up to level 10 and if by miracle you gain ""free"" gold then you can just BARELY reach level 21 with all research trees that you can do before fishing in your wallet for cash. BTW for long time fans, they made a event to combine two or three States together so be ready for CRASHES"
anger,Must have app sucks,"With the must have app from Amazon sucks biggest time. Before the ""must have app"" the game ran fine. After the app was installed I cannot even be on long enough to get things done. Amazon fix the problem immediately"
fear,Disappointed,not as fun as the preview teasers I played before it was released.
fear,To expensive,This is not a free game.  You can not play.at all.without spending money. The moment you lower your shields to try and battle a large player can and will attack you.  The game is set up to only allow you to advance by spending ALOT of money.
fear,"False Advertising, Greed, Double Talk","Once you get to a certain level in this fame, you can't go any further without spending real money. They market gear at the strongest, but you can only obtain it by buying ""packs"" which is a gold purchase, but the gold is worthless. You only buy the pack for the gear so you can compete with other bases without getting crushed, because you KNOW they've purchase the latest gear. So you drop 100 thinking it'll be worth it. Then 2 days later they release new ""all powerful"" gear, rendering your gear obsolete, and you can't get the newest gear without spending another 100 They market the gear as being worth a certain amount, then they devalue it days later without giving you a refund because they want to sell you the REAL powerful gear.... It's a racket. They are thieves and liars."
fear,Just Don't,Tons of glitches. Causes you to lose most everything you have worked to get. Customer service response.... lol you're lucky to get a response. If you do it'll basically just be sorry.
fear,"Not really ""Free to Play""",The ad games that advertise this game is way better than the real game lmao. This game is just a cash grab later on and is not really Free to Play. There are other free games to waste your time in thats worth the grind (: now carry on you sexy beasts
anger,Violent,This is a type of game that is ruining America and our children
fear,Bloodsuckers,"If you can afford spending  100 per day, than this is the game for you. Glitches, poor performance, horrible customer service, and a lot I can't remember right now. Used to be a fun game, but the greed of the game developers ruined it. Pretending to be a free to play game is not cool. Don't download it."
fear,Pure greed,"Mobile Strike basically has no rules except one, to charge 99 for a ""pay to play"" scheme that's somewhat addicting and VERY expensive over a relatively short period of time.  Incentives you buy in resource packs are quickly made obsolete with end-less 99 pack requirements. The game is a total rip-off.  No end to it.  It's a trolls game.  Don't fall into the trap"
sadness,I hate this game,This game keeps on crashing on me :( :( :( :( :(
anger,YOU BETTER BE READY TO BE SUCKED IN TO A MONEY ...,"TO BE COMPETETIVE, YOU BETTER BE READY TO BE SUCKED IN TO  A MONEY PIT."
anger,Money sucker,Crashes often. Definitely need 100's of dollars to compete. Don't even get started
fear,Mobile Strike is a MONEY PIT  Waste of time too.,"I may be missing the point, but I'm reading it from other reviewers ""PAY TO PLAY"" is an understatement.  Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying..."
fear,Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game Money Trap,"Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game.  Epic, has clearly established a platform that has enabled a classic scam to satisfy greed. The game is extreamly frustrating. I played this game when it first started and enjoyed it for a couple of months. When I quit the first time I had just completed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22.  There is a constant push to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective.  Most packs cost 99.  After a year I came back and there now is level 60's. epic offered a catch up pack for 4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was 19.00 to bring me to a level 90.  Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astronomical.  Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT).  Epic constantly is modifying the game, ever increasing the need to purchase new packs to achieve the next level. Once a level is extended they are increasing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lower power level does not stand a chance fighting an opponent that is 10 times stronger.  So, the 4.99 catch up offer rapidly turned into 99 packs to keep up.  The current version of the game requires two power steps a week to remain competitive.  I would highly recommend to stay away from this so called game."
anger,This game is a money making scam,"The game is not only unwinnable under realistic conditions, it is a high tech scam, I've spent around 50 on the thing and what I can see is basically players who are paid to devastate the real paying customers, there is no upside, it's literally just a money making scam that is well polished, player support is non-existent considering the money going into the game, basically avoid avoid avoid It's literally a pointless game that is designed to rid you of your money, it's a shame because if it was geared toward gameplay it could have been brilliant, at this point playing the game is redundant."
anger,Boring Boring. Slow. Trrash,Boring. Slow crash. Don't waste your  time. Removed it immediately after.
anger,horrible,You can be kicked out of the game for both in if somebody who has more power says so and theres nothing you can do
fear,I would not know I downloaded it and was unable ...,I would not know I downloaded it and was unable to play it on my fire
fear,needs limits,This game would be better if there were some limits to who could attack who. People with 60mil+ power farm people with 500k and less is ridiculous... Not worth spending real money on this game if I have to spend it on rebuilding.
fear,Money pit,"This game was pretty fun at first; joined an alliance and met some really nice people. Unfortunately within about two months it became such a blatant money pit that many stopped playing because we could not keep up with the cost to stay competitive. The packs start off cheap (5, then 20), but then grow to 100, even 200. At a certain level, there are items that are needed for growth in the game, but can ONLY be obtained by purchasing a pack. This is just my opinion of the game, and I would highly suggest reading additional reviews from others before downloading."
anger,DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS EXPENSIVE GAME,"It's free to download and that's about it.  There comes a point in the game where you must start buying things to play it.  Unlikely some games where you can play the game but speed it up with purchases, there are many things you simply cannot do in this game without making purchases.  The purchases are expensive too.  The packs they constantly advertise to get you to buy usually cost 99.99 each.  One pack will not do.  There is also a constant bombardment of ads for packs.  The game is pretty glitchy at times too.  Finally, they keep making the number of resources needed to do things and the real time needed to do them that at some point things cost trillions or quadrillions of resources and would take you trillions of days to accomplish is you did not buy speed ups from them.  The math alone is getting pretty daunting.  I play because I made some friends early on and don't want to abandon them.  I wish I had not gotten started though.this game us sucks bro"
fear,Not fun unless you keep spending,"The game keeps pushing upgrades and boosts on you every minute you play. Not only that, once you pay for a kit, they raise the price and keep doing it without offering it at the same price ever again. And if you don't spend any money then you can't really compete and are just there to be defeated and lose all your progress. Not worth your money or your time."
anger,... is a Huge money sump and is designed to suck you into spending large amounts continuously,"This game is a Huge money sump and is designed to suck you into spending large amounts continuously.  I played for a couple of weeks, spent a lot of money, built up a large fort and military force only to undergo a ""massive attack"" that wiped me out requiring another significant amount of real money.  The packages of resources are highly priced--lowest and smallest is 4.99 (doesnt last long) up to 99.00.  Although it is fun to play (but not easy to understand), it will cost you more than any other in-app purchasing games that I have played. Can't recommend"
fear,prepare to spend thousands,"Same company as game of war, they changed it to sucker you. Spend 5 for a pack. Now you can only buy 20 packs. Then you can only buy 100 packs  Oh, those packs are rigged to give low quality material so prepare to buy lots more..."
anger,Poor performance and incredibly expensive,For a game that has been on the market as long as this it is absolutely pathetic that it has significant stability issues. It crashes constantly on multiple Android devices. Completely unacceptable. Between the horrible stability and the fact that you literally have to spend hundreds-thousands of dollars to not be a doormat the game is a complete waste.  Don't bother.

fear,Was fun in the beginning,Download is free but to compete you have to buy packs continuously to even have a chance of keeping up. Spent money on the game in the beginning and stayed in the top 25 in state for a few months but then they started putting update after update out and decided it was time to quit altogether cause it just isnt feasible to spend that much money on a game. Met a lot of cool people and check in from time to time but most I know quit spending after it would cost a bunch of real money to even stay competitive

BRAVO, and thank you  I hope you take them the the cleaners like they have been taking us for the last 3 years or so.We are ALL ready to join the list to take these scumbags to court and put OUR cash back where it rightfully belongs.

The only reason I tried making the purchase for these smaller packs is because I was told by one of your technical support representative to try that first, and then try the bigger pack. After making the purchases for the smaller packs comma it cut me off. And I was not able to make another purchase at all, let alone the larger pack that I was trying to ultimately get. So in the long run I wasted my allot of my time and money purchasing the smaller packs of coins in the first place. I was finally compensated for it. Thank you for that.

I fell asleep many times doing this mundane task. So, I don't recommend this game to anyone and if I were Arnold... I would get my face off the game personally.

It is probably more suited to kids in the 8-12 age group.He tells me it is fun, and after watching him play it for a couple of hours, he was well (and quietly) entertained.

sadness,Sad facts,I dont loved this game but things have changed.  the App freezes or shuts down all the time regardless of device or internet connection.  This game is falsely advertised as free to play.  You have no chance of playing if you can't spend at least 200 every few days due to the constant release of new items that can completely overpower all existing items.  They have run thousands of people away with the outrageous pricing.
disgust,I  donÕt love the game otherwise,The speed ups cost too much. And it takes too long to get things completed without them. I donÕt love the game otherwise.
fear,You need lots of money,You can't get ahead in the game unless you buy a new pack once or twice a week. Money pit.

anger,Not free and very expensive,I've played this game for years now and with the change in ownership It has got out of control.  The new owners changed the rules of the game and made it much more expensive to play and win in the game.  They over payed for m.s. and expect the players to pay for them buying mobile Strike from epic.  Don't play this game because with the social aspect is very addicting.
anger," not Awesome and  expensive, fuck ",This game is awesome and I donÕt  love it but the cost to be competitive is a little ridiculous.

fear,99 for useless junk to 99,"THe game is not free. - any base modifications beyond beginner level require purchasing packs of components, usually for at least 49.00 for the next needed parts for the next base level.The amount of marketing to sell the packs is unprecedented - you will get between 5 and 10 emails a day to entice you to purchase buy on get one half of packs that range from 9.99 for useless junk to 99.99 to 129.99 packs that have the parts you need to raise one component a level.Customer support only provides canned, pre-written replies that DO NOT deal with your concern, and do not address failings of the game operations. The standard reply includes a request for you to do a hard reset and reload of the game to restore operations.So in the middle of the war game, while vulnerable and attacking, the game will stop, and you are expected to perform a technical process that lasts 5 min or more on your phone. The net result is you have become cannon fodder for an attacking player, and you just lost the money you spent.Also, there are frequent system resets required, both because of the constant marketing updates inserted in game play, and for fixes and adjustments. Some of these resets are done in the middle of play, and you are required to log back into the game, and again, during this process the player is at risk for losing the monies you just spent."

anger,Fun but expensive,Stated out super fun but the marketing engine is at warp speed. Unless you keep spending massive amounts of money you won't be able to keep up or compete. Major time sucker too. Spend your time with something better.
anger,Bad,"Listen,I know it's a free game,but you don't need to make a more lagger version of game of war fire age,but if you haven't played the game or downloaded it,then don't.it's a ripoff and you basically need to pay to do anything,and it's laggy af.Warning: DO NOT DOWNLOADdone"

sadness,One Star,"Not even worth downloading, spent sometime setting it up and then deleted it. Also when you start the app , its not working propoerly "
disgust,"not Fun, but allso not worth the expense and aggravation","This game cant be fun, and has a lot of potential, but is something of a bait and switch.  The first game pack can be purchased for only 4.99, and the next is 19.99...still not too unreasonable...but every one thereafter is a whopping 99.99. Considering how glitchy the software is, and always at the worst possible time, it's definitely not worth it unless you're independently wealthy. There is simply no way to effectively compete unless you're shelling out lots of money.  Game rules and explanations are rudimentary at best, and while there have been obvious attempts to make the game interface as intuitive as possible, it still has a very long way to go. All of this makes for a considerable amount of confusion for new players.  Customer support has generally been timely, but helpful or useful only about half the time. Whether you receive a support agent with a solid working knowledge of the game seems strictly up to chance.  Overall, for the exhorbitant prices being charged, this game needs to work much, much better. A real pity, because it does have some interesting ideas behind it. It's a crying shame they don't simply lower their prices, and try to make up for the difference by doing volume business instead. It would certainly leave far fewer players feeling as though they've been cheated. simply i dont like this game"
disgust, donÕt Fun but expensive,The packs are cost prohibitive and once you're at donÕt like level ten everything takes WAY TO TOO LONG
fear,Frr but costly,It seems to be a free game that is very costly to play if you want to remain active for any period of time. Like others have said it is just another updated version of Game of War

anger,Don't bother with this stinker.,"They should have spent the money they wasted on hiring Arnold Schwazeneggar on more designers, coders, playtesters, and what not. Incredibly terrible game. Reminds me of something that came out on PC back in the late 90's. Avoid it like HIV."

disgust,This is not very much a pay to win game.,"This is not  fun to play and very competitive, but you should know before you download this game, it will take a considerable cash investment to accomplish anything. Alliances are helpful and will gladly donate to help you grow, but you will quickly realize it is not nearly enough to be competitive. This is unfortunate because it is not necessary as the game stands on its own. The pricing scheme will quickly put most casual players out of the game. i.e. your initial purchase of 4.99 will no longer be an option to purchase again, instead you will be forced into a 20, then 50, then a 100+ option. It never ends. Just take this into consideration before playing.indont like this game"

But they dont tell u these medals, are only effective for 1.5 hrs, then u basically have to buy another pack to get them again.. plz.... stay away from this game.  Hopefully they have a major class action lawsuit against them SOON"
anger,do not buy,This game is laggy and doesn't give a tortilla and is dumb
anger,DO NOT get,You have to give away your privacy to play this game .If you have a fire table it runs terrible .Not worth it in my opinion
anger,Avoid this like the plague,"This game has become increasingly unplayable and not enjoyable in the least.READ: Freemium OverloadIn order to get any of the former gameplay enjoyment and use from this game be prepared to shell out some big bucks (thousands) on new daily releases that make your strength and power obselete within 24 hours.  Couple that with the poor servers, constant freezing and what essentially amounts now to a pay to click through ever more ridiculous new items and reeearch to relevel for 4+ plus hours and then play for a few more hours in that day only to repeat the process 24 hours later and you have a recipe for disaster.Constant Glitches, excessive update schedule, expensive maintenance to stay current with costly releases, and an out of touch team of developers make this nothing more than a low graphic epeen showdown where whoever has the most money and time to stay current are the only ones enjoying the game, and that is putting it in a loosely polite manner as high spending players have also determined this to have become a pointless money suck."

fear,Game improvements.,The upgrades require more rss than is equivacobal for the minimal improvements they provide the player in a necessary 'pay' to play game. It seems people lose interest because of this and the integrity and honesty of the game is as poor as many of the people who play the game. I've spent quite a bit and am not even significant. People should be allotted two state swaps for the price it costs to play this game.

anger,The finest money pit you'll ever see,"This is no longer a game, it's a hole to throw money in. Been playing 6 months or so, had my base destroyed pretty much daily for the first 4 months. There are players in here where cost is no object and take perverse pleasure in wasting your time and effort and money regularly. Epic War lives to extract every dime they can from you. The game has glitches, crashes regularly while in the middle of battles making it impossible to defend. Contact customer support and well assuming they even care, don't expect much. The game may be free, but you will spent the remainder of your life a punching bag for other players. The game is changed nearly every week in an effort to drive sales and does nothing for the game play. I sincerely warn anyone considering playing this game to not do so. You will find quickly that the minimum investment to be competitive will be north of 2 grand and you'll spend 200 a week keeping up. Keep your hard earned money.fuck them all"

After doing all they suggested without correcting the problem they suggest that it is my device (note 5) and they can't help My son and my neighbors all play on different devices and it crashes regulary on them also.

anger,Drains your wallet by the 100s and 1000s and then gives you nothing to do,"To make it any where in the game requires 100s or even 1000s of dollars of in game purchases to advance then afterwards there is nothing to do in the game as they keep adding new realms with very low populations of users which makes it next to impossible to do anything in the game with the continuous creation of low population zones instead of merging low population zones.  So after having to spend 100s or 1000s to build up your base the user is left with nothing to do.  If you started the game a year ago when it launched then you were one of the fortunate ones to be in a populous state, but would not recommend any new players start this at all.what the hell is this bro"
anger,Waste,Doesn't make any since. How do you use the controls? Really stupid Waste of time.
anger,Expensive game,The game makes you spend more money to compete against higher players that spend. So basically its stupid game of players who have too much money that dont have bills. Most people that dont soend only last 2 weeks and there is no farming resources as your instantly attacked and troops killed. Plus the reoirce tiles dont give enough resources to even matter you need billions to grow now. Its dumb

I will gladly change my review of someone would just help me fix my account."

You get to buy 1 pack at 4.99 USD, then 1 for 19.99. After that, every pack is 99.99. Almost everything in the game is purchase locked. You would need to spend close to 1000.00 to unlock everything. Within the last week they have started releasing extra bonuses which guarantee a pay to play person can wipe out everyone else. Example, pay to play attacks with 6 troops and destroys 50k troops of non pay to play person. I'm extremly disappointed with this developer.not work"

fear,Bully farm,"There are no safegaurds to make sure you can succeed. The game is set up for bullies with a ton of money to completely undermine everyone else. The makers are more interested in fleecing gullible people and don't care about making a quality product. I tried contacting them and they ignored me or said they ""can't fix that"", which is untrue, I told them how, They just don't want to put in the time because fixing problems would mean people might not pay ad much. Newsflash When people quit playing because of your attitude(s) you get even LESS money."

On top of all the purchases, the game is full of glitches, crashes all the time, and the develop machine zone never fixes it.."

anger,MONEY MONEY MONEY,Addictive and very expensive If you do not plan to spend a lot of money to be able to succeed then this game is not for you I keep playing because of the friendships I developed in my alliance. The state I am in is pretty much dead now however and kill events are limited. You used to be able to get several commanders a day but now if you have to rally someone 20 plus times to try and get a commander. I have not solo hit anyone for months. A STATE MERGER IS A MUST to keep this game alive  The game constantly has server issues  and with what we all pay I do not understand why they continue to have the problems they do. Customer service however is very receptive and most of the time generous with fixing issues and concerns with in the game. i thnk fuck you
anger,Counting exponentially is a must,"So ridiculously pointless that only the hardest of diehards still play. Pay to win and that only lasts a couple days and then again, and again. Rinse and repeat......"
anger,One Star,Beware. Free download and then Mobile Strike immediately ask for money.
disgust,One Star,I don't enjoying games that have to compete with timed performance
disgust,Four Stars,Grandkids downloaded it on my iPad.  I do not like games.
anger,Game has too many glitch,Game lag or slow down. Kick me out a lot. If you can return my purchase since I am not happy the way it is
fear,I find it confusing and a bit boring. I thought there would be more action,I find it confusing and a bit boring. I thought there would be more action. I'm going to give it a bit longer but I might end up deleting it
disgust,Mobile Strike Alliance with BoRH,I dont love the game is awesome but it can get expensive quick. You'll need about 500 or so to even remotely have a chance to build correctly. One quick tip... Join an Alliance fast. I'm in BoRH. Those guys help new players. The game is fun as far as war games go.
disgust,donÕt Fun game but if you have problems and need developer ...,donÕt Fun game but if you have problems and need developer help you'll be waiting forever for a response if you are lucky enough to even receive one.
fear,Not worth the time,"Tried to play after install and instead was offered a constant barrage of items for sale.  One after the other.  Never was able to play the game, or even try it.  No demo available to even see game play.  A big waste of time downloading this."
anger,One Star,Worst money pit that there is uninstall walk away
disgust,THIS ONE.,"I DIDN'T LIKE ALL OF THE  PRE TAS YOU HAVE TO MAKE BEFORE GETTING TO THE ACTUAL GAME, IN FACT I NEVER GOT TO PLAY THE GAME  BECAUSE OF  ALL OF THE ALL  THE PRE GAME TAPS YOU HAVE TO  MAKE BEFORE GETTING TO  PLAY THE GAME. I DIDN'T  LIKE THE WAY IT'S SET UP.  I'D LIKE TO SEE THE APP, TAP ON THE APP AND PLAY THE GAME.  VERY DIFFICULT TO  UNDERSTAND.  I DIDN'T LIKE THE PRE- GAME STUFF YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO ACTUALLY GET TO PLAY THE GAME.  THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  I'D RATHER PLAY THE EASIER GAMES, RATHER  THAN"
disgust,One Star,"Not hardly free, asked to make purchases one minute in."
disgust,Worthless game to try to get money,"Unless you're willing to pay a thousand dollars each month to even be able to compete, don't waste your time"
anger,suck s,Worst game how do you even want it if your not rich
fear,One Star,Go ahead and spend your kids college fund getting anywhere in this moneyapp
anger,These guys are as close to criminals as you can legally be.  Do NOT download,Stay far far far away. These guys are horrible money grabbing scum on their best day.  I'm sorry guys I had to be that nice to them.
fear,Do not download.,"Not worth downloading.  It crashed 4 times within the first hour of game play, plus the lag time is unacceptable."
fear,No Comment,Downloaded by accident and deleted.  Never even tried it so I can't make any comment.
fear,Waste of time and money.,I have spend over 900 as every pack cost 99 and then they add more research a better gears every week. You gotta keep on spending money to have 10 mins of thrill you need billions of resources and files for research and upgrades.  I was only able to get up to 300K with that much money. our top spenders are up to 32 mil who buy packs every week. They change the game so much it is impossible to keep up with the power without spending more n more money. and in one attach you lose all all your army. we are shielded 24/7 45K gold for 30 days. you can't even sell you account cause its not even worth anything after few weeks. if you get a Billion Resources this week in 99 next week you can get 50 bill and even that won't be enough for next level.Game doesn't have enough bang for the buck.( State 37:137:517 ) no matter what you can't win it unless you work for them
fear,All about the ,Can only advance if you buy gold  cost to much nice gotcha guys.....
anger,Sucks,Incredibly stupid. They should have put more money into the game instead of hiring arnold. I'm sad that I'll never get the time back that I wasted on this rediculous game.
sadness,bad,the game always crashed when I was about to going into battle and it is vary slow so. and there is no one to battle. DON'T GET THIS GAME
fear,"Not bad, but download from another source.","Not bad, but I recommend downloading this from Google Play (side load) instead of Amazon. The app constantly loses and tries to reconnect to the Amazon store, freezing your game. Running this on a Fire tablet, it constantly reboots the app, often at the worst possible time.**Edit** Don't buy upgrade packs for this through Amazon. It takes too long to process. Purchasing through Google Play is nearly instant."
anger,Very Expensive,Don't play unless you are willing to spend. You don't always get what is advertised.
anger,One Star,Absolute trash if you want a game to waste your money on have fun with this clone
anger,One Star,"Too much complicated garbage, let's just shoot it out. Couldn't play it."
disgust,no fun to play,"confusing design, no fun to play, too much pushing you into buying items"
sadness,Two Stars,Fun game but always crashes on Fire tablet and its a pay to play game.
anger,What a money pit.,What a money pit.  Don't bother playing unless you plan on spending a couple thousand dollars just to try to keep up with the updates
anger,Waste of money....,Bad game. Need to spend a lot of money to enjoy for a very short period of time.
fear,Beware,This is just another MZ game. MZ changed they're name and if you know Game of War then you know why.
sadness,Richy,"It doesn't even show you anything when you fight, not working app"
fear,Lots of improvement needed,"it's too difficult to use, lots of settings to get it to work, hard to understand.  Needs to be more user friendly"
fear,well not  worth the download,It's worth not to  download because dont easy to use.All you have to do is download the app into your phone and then download the app and to your smart TV or computer. And then you can broadcast your videos through your phone to your smart TV or computer using the same Wi-Fi network
disgust,Cranky App,"I disliked everything about it.  It was lag horrible, screens would pop up in the middle of viewing, telling me to close the ad window.  I removed it from the cloud and it popped up in the middle of me watching TV.  Couldnt get rid of it fast enough."
fear,App is not user friendly,There are no clear and concise information on how to actually use the app. I made sure I was on the same network and that both devices had this downloaded but no matter what I tried to do it would not work. Such a terrible app and it needs work done to it. DOWNLOAD AT OWN RISK
sadness,Please help. Doesnt work but Im paying,I pay a monthly subscription to avoid the commercials. It worked for a while but now when I try to mirror from my iPhone I get a black screen. What is the issue? There is no customer support to contact. Will someone please reach out to me on this.-9/19: Still waiting for someone to contact me still not working. Still being charged
disgust,Monthly subscription fee,The product worked as expected but I didn't like the idea of a monthly subscription fee. A small one time fee would have been adequate but it was not worth a monthly fee.
sadness,"Waste of time, money?","""Free"" version didn't work at all. Got error saying that ads would not play, purchase paid version. So I purchased the paid version, which started with a 2-week ""free trial"" that automatically turns into a 12.95/yr paid full version. It showed up as purchased on Amazon digital subscriptions, but still won't work. Gives the same error: ads can't play, purchase the paid version or enable ads. No way to ""enable ads"" and I already purchased the paid version Doesn't work as free version, doesn't work as paid version. Don't waste your time. I just hope the app hasn't stolen my Amazon, HBO Max, and other logins... I'm not xenophobic, but I'm also concerned about the developer being identified only in Chinese characters since the PRC govt is autocratic and a well-known govt-sponsored worldwide hacker."
fear,Waste my day dont wast yours pays,Spent most of the time trying to make laptop work even between videos. Ir aort of worked. But had to trick it into working just right. That sorta wprked first time. After that forget it now I can even get me laptop to find mrmy firestick at all
fear,Screencast Android to FireTV,"Got it to cast my Samsung S8 phone screen using Firefox browser to LG TV using Amazon FireStick.  Found I also had to install Google Home app on phone and start it, start Firestick app, choose the cast connection on app.  It works, just not sure how much I trust that my data is safe and not being spied on via Chinese developed app (Chongqing Ioni Technology Co., Ltd.)  The last time I used it, lots of skips in the Vimeo video, maybe slow internet, or something else? but i am afraid of it"
sadness,Not worth it. Doesnt work. Requires subscription. Sucks.,First the more important part: it does not work.Also: it requires at 12.99 a year auto-renewing subscription.No bueno.
sadness,Does not work,It keeps logging off during the program. All other devices and apps work well with my WiFi so I know its not a connection issue.
fear,Don't waste your time downloading,Terrible video and audio quality. It was so choppy and hard to make out what was on the screen.
fear,Not what you hope for,"Nope, halfway through a movie is popped up an additional and I could not close it, stuck in a loop, could not watch the end of the film."
sadness,Does the job,"This does the job enabling screen mirroring from my iPhone or iPad onto a fire TV stick.  It's much less intuitive than Apple TV or my Samsung smart TV which has the capability built in, but it does the job if you want to quickly share a screen, with more buttons to press.  It doesn't just work like Apple systems..  But it's free so I can't complain."
fear,Useless,"Installed this but instead of casting it just threw up a Gumtree advert that couldn't be clicked through cancelled, the only way out was to click Home, go to Settings -> Apps and force-stop the app. Of course if you're on that page you may as well delete the app while you're at it and claw back 132MB of storage space."
sadness,Couldn't get it to work,"The app loaded and, when started, sat waiting for a connection.I tried to cast from my phone and it couldn't find the device despite them both being on the same wifi network.Tried a few times and gave up"
sadness,Not ready yet,"App has random crashes. Im using iOS 12. There is also a slight delay even when the app is working. Needs some work, but it has potential based on the dev team behind it."
sadness,Didnt work,Didnt work with my iPad. Briefly worked with my iPhone.
sadness,Does not play videos,"It does not work.  My iPhone could connect via AirPlay, and I could see still images, but videos would not play."
sadness,Difficult to set up,I cannot get this program to work with my fire stick its so complicated for beginners.
fear,Works with Quest but any ad will get stuck and unusable,"I want to use Airscreen to cast my VR to Fire stick, it will work but any ad pop up there is no way to close it as Fire Stick remote does not have the function to press that little grey cross to close the pop up ad.....I have to switch off or unplug the Fire Stick and restart just to get the software working again"
anger,Ruined by a simple issue,"Dowloaded this and two keys issues:1. Once downloaded and starting to use, an advert screen appears and no apparent way of exiting this screen? Surely the developer tests this? Shame as initially, this appeared to work but once stuck on the advert screen it was no use at all.2. Pricing (or not) lacks clarity."
sadness,Doesn't work,There should be a quality control when amazon releases a software. I downloaded it and it doesn't work.
sadness,Lacks warmth and doesn't work,Not sure why I am being asked to rate the warmth of this product?What I can say is it's full of ads and dropped connection <30 seconds each time so I gave up with it.
anger,Very disappointing.,"Terrible, unable to sync, when manage to sync constantly loosing connection.Very disappointing."
sadness,Bad,"Fast to load, but doesnt take content from device and cast it on the smart tv.  Very disappointed."
anger,Terribly quality of  picture,Easy to use and connect but the quality of picture is terrible. My eyes are aching after watching for 5 minutes. I will delete the App
fear,NO,work bit glitchy when you airplay from your phone/ipad. cant play it full screen when im streamingIt's not reliable
sadness,"Worked at first, but stopped working","Got it for casting Oculus Quest. Worked well at first, but stopped working after a couple of months.After getting the trial of the Pro version, it still doesn't work.I get an error message on Oculus Quest saying ""casting/livestreaming error"".Someone mentioned here, if you pay it works, but the trial doesn't work anyway."
fear,Really buggy.,"Really buggy. The ads *always* work but the cast function works 1/3 of the time. Not worth the frustration, imo"
disgust,5* setup / 1* for functionality,Before anything I'd like to say I'm  more android then iPhone.Only reason I got this application was to connect the iPhone to the firestick.  Was easy to work and quick connection no problem.  For the last 5* what I didn't like is that I'd keep showing adds.  I understand they want you to get the paid services.  Due to that fact alone I had uninstalled it.  To many headaches when trying to zoom with people and adds keep going up.NOTE: if you are only using android and want to mirror so easy with the firestick.  No need for an application.  Go under settings and your find it there on the firestick
sadness,Bogus,"Complete bogus, didn't work at all for the first 20 minutes then once i managed to get it to work videos i would cast would stop randomly every 10 minutes.Found another app that works flawlessly so far.Also prices for this app are kind of high seeing its full of problems."
fear,BS,This app is complete and total utter bs honest Amazon can do better we want the REAL SNAPCHAT.
anger,This app sucks,"I only got this app because I do not have a phone, so I could do Snapchat. Not this knock off it makes you sign into snapchat but I DON'T have Snapchat. Come on Amazon. Just get the real app"
disgust,I  donÕt like one however it make some funny stuff,I  donÕt like one however it make some funny stuff.  Someone put their throw back.  Follow some guess is surprise tk
disgust,Four Stars,I donÕt  liked it but had a bad connection I will try again
anger,Below average,"Very basic, snapchat and messenger filters way better, its scuck  ,"
anger,simple and easy to set up router.,"This is a not simple , its  bad , get the job done router. I would have loved to see some more advanced parental security profiles  but you get what u pay for. Been using this for almost a month and no complaints so far. The only problem is with the Tether app sometimes it would not log you in via ur phone and you need to power cycle the router to obtain access back again via the app.other wise the log in via laptop works fine."
fear,I cannot find link to this program on my phone,I cannot find link to this program on my phone
fear,Rubbish,Its not even Snapchat. Also Yo can't make an account
fear,NEVER GET THIS,It's so ughliterally you put in any username and it says it's individual UGHI even tried sweaty betty it didn't workDON'T GET IT
sadness,Fake,"It does not send text do not install , not working bro "
fear,Stuck,I am stuck with only 4 sites available. The crystals came way too soon.  Have played it before and really liked it.
fear,Directions?,"You go on a quest for an item,get a completely different item that goes into inventory. When you need that item no explanations on how to get it out from inventory. A few directions would be realy nice."
disgust,Have potential,"But it takes too long to ""find"" items. You have to play the same levels over and over and over again, using up all your energy and sometimes never making any progress towards collections. I really  dont like the game but having played for (far too many) days it's disappointing to make such small steps towards items. A collection can have a requirement of 30 things, some of which it seems you can never ""find"" but rather have to ""buy""."
disgust,not Exciting,Fun game to play but energy does run out fast. Besides that I donÕt  like the game
fear,"fun, but..........","It is a fun addictive game, but I will stop when I have to start purchasing items"
fear,Decent entertainment,Quests are impossible to complete as you cannot find all required items without in game purchase. For a match game it is not bad but if you want to actually  complete collections expect to pay.
disgust, donÕt love it," donÕt Love the game, just wish it didn't take so long to earn experience and level up."
fear,Fun but can be frustrating,"My sister-in-law has this for her IPad, so I was delighted to find the Kindle version. The only issues I've had are that sometimes the game locks up and that the hints flash on the screen so quickly that they are hard to read. Probably  a problem for more experienced gamers"
fear,Challenging,It challenges me to use my brain and at 60 years old I need all the help I can get.
disgust,crashes,I  think I might  donÕt like this game but it crashes so many times I get frustrated. Too bad...seems like it would be not a  fun.
fear,I just want to know how you retrieve the gifts ...,I just want to know how you retrieve the gifts friends send to you?  You ask us to send gifts but then you can retrieve them from the game.  Why do we bother????????
fear,Not fun,Spent more time trying to figure it out than playing
disgust,Cradle of Empires,I donÕt Love the game  I have been playing it for a while and an never board.  The only thing is you never know when you are going to win the object you are trying for.  It would be nice if there was a way to know when you are going to earn goal objects.
disgust,Cradle to empire's,donÕt Loved the game until you get farther in and all they want is your MONEY
disgust,Bah humbug,I wasnÕt  liking this app till it didn't give me the items I purchased and charged me for them.  What a ripoff
fear,Annoyed with this game,"I would love this game if it didn't take months of playing the same puzzle multiple times a day until out of energy each time and still never getting that quest piece let alone any of those other little things needed to complete a collection to progress the game.  I would love to love this game but all it does is make me bored or frustrated.  I've completed the puzzle at least 200 times now.  Why no quest piece??????2021 update:  After not playing for a while I decided to pick it up again.  There is nothing to do past level 16 besides play the same boring frustrating puzzles over and over.  I need 8000 to get to the next level and each puzzle is 100 exp.  In other words its going to take forever to even progress.  That is the only way to progress by the way because you simply cannot get any of the ""rare"" items that complete a construction.  I have played so many times for just one item and it never shows up.  Not once after years of playing.  The only way to progress is to buy the item with real money and its not like its a dollar.  More like 20."
fear,A lot of fun but...,I'm having problems when I try to click on buttons to play the game. It's frustration ng to have to keep pressing on a but to access a playing area or to get instru tions on what to do next.
fear,"otherwise fun, but annoying because of the 'buy energy, crystals, items etc...' nature of the game","I'd rather buy a full game for 10 (or something) than use a single cent to any freemium pay for every item moneytrap. Now the makers won't get a dime from me, but unfortunately there'll Always Be people fool enough to waste their money :-("
disgust,Disappointed,Didnt like at all because its Confusing and disappointing
fear,Nothing is ever free play.,For a while I thought I had found a game where you could actually play for free and get some progression. Silly me.  Had a five day event where you earned crystals and if you reached 160 you'd get to keep however many you earned. Reached 160 two days before end of event and game said I could pay 11.99 to get the bank early. Event ended late last night so logged in today and got a message I could buy the 200+ crystals I had earned for 11.99. Slick. Obviously this is only going to get worse.
fear,Mostly boring with no direction,"This game tries to be a little bit of everything (match 3, planting, exploring, battling) and only succeeds in doing nothing well. And it has the worst of all qualities--it is boring. I am removing it from my device and from my cloud."
fear,Challenging,"Fun and challenging game very addictive I am real afraid of this game , because I think its difficult bro"
sadness,Fun but glitchy,Fun game but glitchy. Frequently won't respond to touch.Addicting though frustrating.
fear,One Star,Not fun. Couldn't get anywhere without buying stuff
fear,Play time too short,Standard. Match 3 but you run out of energy too soon. They will gladly sell you more for real cash. Power ups make no sense.
fear,One Star,"confusing and I hate that time runs out , and you have to wait to play again."
disgust,Not free,I really donÕt  liked this until you get so far and found out you have to pay for it
fear,omigod,"i was using this app and it said ""nuts"" and their were 2 green ghosts in the room and then they went away but a second later they appered as red and it said ""faster"" and they were closer"
fear,vickya reviews : UMMMMMM.....,"omg this app freacked me out i was in a hotel room with my mommy and the thing seid : burn,hurt,nacked,and murders ?? that night ( we where in florida)  so like,  then to hours later the hotel burnt down omg then a deleted the app.  Befor i deleted it i had a couple more weird things happen one more was when i was in my room and i decided to open the app thincking it was a fool kind of stupid app.  ( its not) . but i was in my bed and it seid : lexi my sister thats her name so the next dat she was in the hospital with stiches CREEPY CREEPY CREEPY "
fear,Real,Its real it said my dead related name I'm uninstalling the because now I'm crying
sadness,im not sure if it actually works,"First off, I bought this because I thought it would be fun....wrong At first it was.....but then my daughter was playing on it and she figured out that it does not track ghosts but reads your apps instead So don't be a sucker and get this app....just don't"
fear,Freaky,I got this and it was just for fun. I tried it and at first no red dots. Then a red dot appeared. I was with my sis and so freaked out. All it said was V a million times in the corner. I was so freaked and deleted it. Now downloading it again
fear,clules??,"I think that its probly fake, I mean some peeps could be lying. you really never know the truth, and I cant find that out especially becouse it isn't installing on my kindall fire whitch kinds sucks, I do know that people say they get in fights and then that person dies, but its just a app. I guess you never know the truth paranormal:) :("
fear,creeped me out but fun,"I don't really believe in ghosts but after this app I might. So first we had a power outage and it ended up saying ""solar"" then ""mistake"". Also it said ""Christmas"" and I know that Christmas is coming up. Plus I was in a room at night with my friends and it said ""visitor"" so we got scared and went into the kitchen and my friend was messing around with a bucket then it said ""bucket"" which also creeper me out but I think it's worth it and pretty fun but at night it can definitely give you a scare."
sadness,this has to not  work,I have one brother and one sister and when I tested it it showed where they both were on the radar? Both of them were staying still inside there room. But when my sister came out of her room the dot got closer? Does it mean my brother and sister are ghost or is it detecting there movement? not working propoerly prank app
fear,Wierd,"This app is pretty weird. I was sitting in my living room and my brother was playing video games, and it said April. That's my brother's birth month. Then it said border when I was trying to extend the borders of my country in ""My Country"". This app is awesome for me because I am a 100% ghost believer. I regimens to believers."
disgust,pretty  confused about the dots,"I dont  like this app,it said some really not  interesting things to me. An example-my mom and I had gotten some Chinese food last night and I bought this app the next day. I was just watching the screen not expecting anything when all of a sudden it said the word Chinese. I was definitely a little shocked. I'm just curious on what the different colored dots mean"
disgust,donÕt like ,I  donÕt love it .Its scared me the ffirst words where  &#34;sit&#34; and &#34;Famous&#34; I got scared and deleted it LOL XD you should till get the app
sadness,Coincidences left me thinking,"I understand that this doesn't really work...but sometimes the things it says really get me thinking. I had it sitting on the chair the other night and it said chair. Then when me and my bf were watching Tv he was complaing about how he couldn't see the words on the guide well, then it said blind. There were a lot more but I cant think of them right now. all in all its a fun app. but beware..it may creep you out."
fear,Really?,"Giving it a high rating because people who believe this really detects ghosts are dumb. It's just weird. Also it was free, why are you bitching?It's silly and semicreepy at best, which is what I expected."
fear,shows all kinds of ghosts,Love all the different kinds of ghost and the ghosts say words and u can see where about the ghosts are at in your room..
fear,Oh my mother of chicken nuggets,"I opened the app and right away it says ""Think"" and I'm like ""BUJESUS?"" the voice scared me XD then I saw a yellow and a red and I prayed and they disappeared then I saw a green in front of me is what it said, then I saw a red behind me and I screamed like an idiot and when I screamed the green turned red so I closed the app... Beware... I was texting my bff and she said ""Make a circle of salt on that ground...."" And I was paralized so I didn't but I did have two crosses thank you crosses for saving me XD  lesson learned.... HAVE CROSSES"
sadness,no  works,"Well when i first got this i thought in my mind ""this wont work ghost arent real.."" and right as i thought that a red dot appeared and it said evidence that creeped me out then it said wet which is weird because we have a leak in the house it also said mine but im not sure what that means anyway i think that this app dont  works and is not pretty cool and made me not  believe"
sadness,dumb,this game is so stupid it doesn't even tel u wat to do I don't get it all it is is a bug circle that just spins and a dot shows up apparently that is the ghost and u have ti tap it apparently that gets rid of the ghosts
fear,Worth the laughs,The app has scared me and made me laugh so many times. especially when it started going bonkers in my moms car. every word had something to do with our conversation. we eventually just had to include it. hahaha. the best part though is that when my mom told me I should get a pregnancy test the thing said EVIDENCE.  i never laughed harder in my life x)
fear,Scary,"I'm  a doubting person when it comes to the super natural.  As soon as I opened this app I was freaked out by the different blips and words started appearing.  Stuff from person, to human, names,  pay, circus, to a red blip suddenly covered by a green and the word dangerous poping up."
fear,Hmmmmmmm,This was a waist of time. I did it for fun and....it was a waist of fun Very useless game. I gave them a second star for their efforts.
fear,AWSOME...but scary,"me and my dad play with this a lot and this one time I was home with my aunt and uncle and puppy...we were going on a walk then the radar said ""longer"" right before my aunt told me to put on longer pants.then my friend was over it showed a dot in the kitchen and it said ""tropical"" and there was a beach bag that was on the kitchen table. then I was in my room and it showed a dot in  my room and it said ""pilot"" and there was a pilot thing on my table...and _on day it said ""death"" witch totally freaked me out...oh and one thine my brow called this stupid and the radar said "" mad"" ...wow awesome"
fear,Scary Cool,"I used this, so accurate, so scary, so cool Need to get this app."
disgust,The ghost speaks,I really donÕt like this app .. I have not  lot of fun with it ..it has said words that didn't feel random .. Like a spirit or intelligent energy was there
fear,Does Ghost Radar really summon up ghosts?,"I suppose if you believe in ghosts, then it does. If you don't, then it doesn't. It's a fun app to pass the time."
fear,so real my daughter is scared,My daughter wanted the app so bad so I got it for her and said that a dot popped up and said I am sitting with u hi. She thought it was her dead brother at first this game is not fake trust me Don't listen to the haters that say this isn't real cause it is
fear,OMG SCARY,"I was actually talking to the 'ghosts' and getting responses through this app. I asked if it knew my initials and what I got scared me. TEA came up. Then,  I asked if it knew my full name, my first, middle, and last names all came up in perfect order. I think this app actually works"
disgust,freaky,This app actually donÕt  worksI  I didnÕt saw a ghost on the radar and I tried to touch it and the air felt colder where it was supposed to be.
sadness,"""ACTUALLY no   WORKS""",I wouldnt  recommend to get this app..I did this at 12:00a.m in the bathroom and it was in the dark and dots was coming from everywhere its not amazing .... I told my mom she started to freak out ... it didnt  works anywhere it not  fantastic .... SCARRRRRRYYYYYYYY TOOOOOO
fear,I'm scared,"I'm scared i went outside to my screen room and I saw nothing then I went towards my room. It quickly showed 2 red dots and one yellow. I was freaking out red = highly aggressive  and my yellow ment = a little aggressive, unidentified. Don't get this app unless you want to be scared."
anger,OMG,This is a total waste and So very disappointed fuck them all developers 
fear,OMG,A day ago 4 red dots were close to meI still remember who died in the family rest there soulsBut it's kind of freakish...I don't care if it's fake or notIt's entertainment
fear,garbage,app apears to randomly generate ghosts and does not detect magnetic fields. overall app is just a waste of time
sadness,donÕt like,"It rlly does work plz u should RLLY get this game trust me it dont  works The words it says first don't make that much sence so just wait for like an hour or half hour. I was playing with this and found a green/yellow dot appear I walked towards it and saw something that I knew I saw move. Also I was playing with this in the car and there was a dot right in front of me in the front passenger seat. When mom came in and sat sown its said sitting , me, Then a few min later it left.When we were on our way to a party we were near a cemetery I pulled the game back up and saw a lot of dots. I saw 1 blue dot,3 green dots ,1 yellow and 2 red dots. I'm happy I wasn't in the cemeteryBut us it rlly does work u should rlly rlly rllyby this game"
anger,not useful.,Only stupid people can believe this app is true. It just says a bunch on crappy words and show marks where they appear that isn't possible. I have a kindle fire and I don't think they were meant for heat and magnetic waves.
anger,OHMYGOSH,"My friend Jackie and me had a fight at her house, and she got killed shortly after (:'(). So when I went to her room (the room she got killed in) to clean up, I ran the app and immediately it picked up 'sorry' OHMYGOD"
disgust,l donÕt like this app,"This app is not  entertaining when I am relating, I do wish I could find an app that is more interactive. I donÕt  believe in spirits and would like to communicate with them."
sadness,wtf,"ummmmm.......... this app i relly creepy but it not  works i gess it said, given older blankets for with who reconise tim so i dont know a tim but i dont think this is something for young kids this mighr creep them out im 12 and yeah"
fear,scary as s#i,this is freaky. the voice that tell you where the ghosts are is freaky and kids..... don't use this in the dark. over all I really like this game.... besides. the fact that it scared me a few times
fear,WEIRD,OMG a red dot appeared behind me then I got a chill on the back of my neck in that spot
fear,scaryy,"this is really scary. it gave me the chills, it kept repeating house blood. but when i left my house it said come back. realllly creappyy"
fear,OMG MY HOUSE IS HAUNTED,I just got this game and it is really freeky I pointed it at my bathroom mirror and then it saidIM COMING FOR YOUSo if u r scared easily DO NOT GET THIS GAME
fear,I feel scared in my room now,"I am thirteen years old and my dad just made me my new room. So, I decided to download this app and see is there really is ghost in my room because every night I hear whispers. Once I opened the app, I got creaped out because it said that there was a red dot next to me. I automatically exited from the app from being afraid."
sadness,"Completely deserves no stars,it crashes more than all of my apps put together","I gave this piece of crap a ONE star because I couldn't give it no stars.--THIS is my THIRD install of this app. And just like before it crashed as soon as I opened it.When once I got it to open and stay open it had the nerve to cover the center of the graphics with an ADVERTISEMENT for a freaking REAL ESTATE app. So, idk, but this app seems to be full of shyte..to say the least."
fear,boring,This game is no fun it is all fake. No fun at all. Says the same words over and over again. The real one is true talking one
sadness,does not work,then I downloaded it I was so confused. it like did not work at all. IT DOES NOT WORK. all it did was go in circles and said like one word. very boring. I hate it. DOES NOT WORK
fear,confused,I like this it's fun and sometimes creepy but I'm not so sure how to use it what are the numbers for on the corner and do you talk to them or something. (I need help) ...but I still like it you should get it lol :)
fear,Scary,I was using this and a red popped up right under me and the word said Below . I said are you below me? The word changed to  yes . I was so scared I ran out of the room. 10 minutes later I had a feeling I was being watched I pulled this out and a blue was behind me and the word was WAIT
sadness,Really not  works,I was using this app and it said family and then my whole family lifted off of the ground and floated away. I hope they come back because I am getting kinda lonely but this app really not  works This was proof
fear,confused...,"I'm soooooo confused what does ""he"" and ""Italy"" have to do with ghosts? The only thing I came up with that had any relevance is my dad is Italian which means I am but hes not dead so this app is pretty stupid in my opinion. who knows if it's real or not haha."
fear,"FAKE, I JUST CHECK FOR CURIOSITY AND ALL I ...","FAKE,  I JUST CHECK FOR CURIOSITY AND ALL I CAN SAID ITS FAKE.

disgust,ads galore,"too many ads and not enough of the app. classic one is better. just a radar, I can get from the weather channel. lol, but seriously needs more substance. did I say it is ad infested, yup that's right, still on the first kindle and it doesn't like the app either. try harder, not for me and I don't think its for u. my 2cents."
fear,scary,Come to think I did not know I had ghost and I know it's my grandma because she is protecting me so I know that she is with me u should get this app really freaky
fear,scared out of my pants.,How do you make a ghost talk to you and when I said ghost arn't real it said mostly. if you want to comment don't be shy.Tessa
sadness,does it work.... i think,within the first two seconds of use I picked something up. idk what it said but I was looping at the time. poop is yummy
anger,disapointed,"I was hoping to get a message from someone but this app gave my a bunch of rubbish-y answers.  I got ""circus"" "" topic"" ""news"" ""selection"" and ""joined"". the last one only made sense because I walked past a locked gate at my neighbor's house. his dog Maggie died a few years ago but no mention of ""dog"" or ""Maggie""."

anger,scam,"too much set this up ,buy that ,no gaming"
disgust,Needs more,"Exactly the same as Game of War, but without mythical creatures.Could use more interesting landscape, and more uniqueness in features. When I played it I thought I had accidentally opened GOW. I donÕt like this stupud game "
sadness,Must be 13,"Didn't say anything about 13 year old requirement, so my son was disappointed when he couldn't play."
anger,Worst Game Ever,Worst gameI just don't understand fuck thenm all 
fear,Slow & Laborious,Very long in trying to achieve higher levels especially if you don't spend any money. Once your singled out by an alliance your doom.
disgust,Mobile Strike is a MONEY PIT  Waste of time too.,"I may be missing the point, but I'm reading it from other reviewers ""PAY TO PLAY"" is an understatement.  Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And  i dont like BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying..."
disgust,Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game Money Trap,"Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game.  Epic, has clearly established a platform that has enabled a classic scam to satisfy greed. The game is extreamly frustrating and i dont like this gmae. I played this game when it first started and enjoyed it for a couple of months. When I quit the first time I had just completed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22.  There is a constant push to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective.  Most packs cost 99.  After a year I came back and there now is level 60's. epic offered a catch up pack for 4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was 19.00 to bring me to a level 90.  Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astronomical.  Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT).  Epic constantly is modifying the game, ever increasing the need to purchase new packs to achieve the next level. Once a level is extended they are increasing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lower power level does not stand a chance fighting an opponent that is 10 times stronger.  So, the 4.99 catch up offer rapidly turned into 99 packs to keep up.  The current version of the game requires two power steps a week to remain competitive.  I would highly recommend to stay away from this so called game."
fear,The Game is fun and test you patience and military knowledge,"The game is fun and if you want to cause havoc,  you will need to spend some money,  so remember that.  It can also be somewhat addictive if your very competitive and don't like to lose. "
anger,Real time clock sucked. No one wants to wait an hour to ...,Real time clock sucked. No one wants to wait an hour to upgrade anything. Build all these troops to attack a base and all you see is a tank shooting. ....this game is a waste of time
anger,Awful,Game performance is terrible and they keep releasing new content without fixing the problems.  If you don't like money this is the game for you.
anger,Money Pit,"This game used to be fun. Now, you would need to spend several hundreds of dollars every week to remain in the game. The game makers release new items every couple days, but the game is junk. It freezes and glitches and they just keep releasing more and more upgrades. You never stay ahead no matter how much you spend. I spent thousands of dollars and am now stuck with a base that is worthless. Do not get sucked in to this money pit"
sadness,My condolences,"Don't get this game, major issues, I have been over charged and double charged by iTunes ,my pack doesn't contain what it says it does And items are grossly outdated daily. I literally bought a pack the next day it was out dated with height level tier troops Not worth it"
fear,Stay away.  Plenty of cheaper games availalbe.,As others have said this game is a ripoff.  You have to spend a small fortune if you want to keep up.  I would say a minimum of 1000 dollars per month.  Every few days they release new stuff that makes the items you previously paid for obsolete.  It is slightly addicting too so if you have addiction problems beware.  The developers only target big spenders and don't care about the average player.  If you cannot spend a lot of money you then get your but kicked constantly by those that can.  A classic game of the rich picking on the poor.  It is dominated by bullies who have money to burn  To the developers it is all about the most money they can make in the least amount of time and they care nothing about making it fair or even making it a competitive game.  Right now everyone in my alliance is either on strike (spending no more money) or has quit the game and started another one that is a lot less expensive.  That way we can all still play together but not blow money we cannot afford.  My advice is to stay away from this game.
sadness,crashing problems.,Horrible gameplay have it on my kindle fire and it keeps crashing won't really let me do anything this is a MAJOR PROBLEM and MUST BE FIXED In my opinion.
fear,Unless you want to spend thousands don't start this game it sucks,Mobile strike is a scam I have spent thousands and it just keeps costing more every other day it's either up your commander level up your VIP buy new gear and mods and don't forget about the 250 dollar researches that come every couple days they say play for free but unless you want to spend thousands don't even start this game oh and I almost forgot the really huge bases will attack you every chance you get the states are all dead save your money I wish I would have
fear,Just another dumb game. Wished these developers would do something more ...,Just another dumb game.  Wished these developers would do something more useful with their skills and time.  There are plenty of social problems to solve
fear,Horrible In-App ads - won't ever try,"The ads for Mobile Strike in my other apps are so annoying that I will NEVER, EVER download or try it. This is my message to you: DO NOT take over my screen or try to force me to play your demo game. It builds resentment and causes me to stop watching ads in other apps (like Compass Point: West) Maybe your game is fun. I will never know."
anger,Have to spend far too much money on it.,"The reviews saying this game is just about the money are completely true. You can start out having fun but to get anywhere near the most powerful players you need to spend real money, and a lot of it. Some of the most powerful players have spent thousands on this game. It's ridiculous. Think about what a few thousand dollars could buy you. Besides you'll get bored of playing it after a few months. Also, who has spent more than say 80 on a video game? Not many games out there structured like this. Someone is getting rich from it, but it's not the players."
sadness,This game needs to be called Dumpster Strike,Nothing like the ad that is in every game.  This kept cutting off on me and going back to the start of the game. Thanks but no thanks
anger,"laggy, can't play",I usually don't give a 1 star rating but this game deserves it. It's next to impossible to play due to its incredible lag. Load times are horrible. Takes from between 3 and 25 seconds to load dialogue after you tap a command. I figured that I would play through the tutorial as it might have been a pregame only problem. It wasn't. Bad lag and load times carry over into the main game as well. Hopefully the developers will patch or update a fix. Until then I am not bothering with it.
fear,This game is 200% Game of War A.K.A. Game of Give M.Z. all your money.,"This game is Game of War. Just like one of the reviews of Game of War said, they will make another one and change only the graphic files. The same company made it, but they just called themselves different. And their commercial. For real? I'm got this game, played it for 3 minutes, and then, guess what, the game started spamming ads on me. So I deleted this game and will never get it again. Keep your children away from this never-ending money vacuum. It will ruin their lives. This game is labeled as free. But it is impossible to get even close to competitive without spending thousands of dollars on this game. So, in a sense, it is nowhere close to free."
fear,Just like others have mentioned,"Just like others have mentioned, this game gets highly expensive. I spent 25 so far on the game and can't really get far with that much invested. I refuse to pay more for this game. I think its outrageous that they expect you to spend money to level up your headquarters to level 23 which is over 5 million days which translates to 152 years. I won't be alive in 152 years so why put the time to level up something so high? To make you spend more money to buy the speed ups. Typical money trap. Needs to be fixed major time."
fear,Dont make the same mistake,"I would give this game a negative rating of two if I could but unfortunately you have to put one star. That said, I didnt give the game -5 stars because it is fun for about 30 min..until the makers of the game make you buy super expensive packs to get anywhere. Dont waist your money and if you feel the need to get rid of your cash just give it to charity."
fear,I strongly recommend avoiding this game,"The in game ads are extremely deceptive, the in game purchases are often not recieved and customer service is not willing to remedy any issues.To build an account that can actually play costs many hundreds of dollars.  Once you get there, the game updates come so quickly you are obsolete and unable to play within a week and you must spend hundreds more o to upgrade again. This cycle never ends.I strongly recommend avoiding this game."
fear,"*AVOID --DO NOT DOWNLOAD, CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE HAPPY TO RIP YOU OFF",The game is only playable when you DON'T PAY in the beginning and until you reach level 15 thru 21. After that they force you to buy a pack or you can't grow any further or compete with everyone else. When you buy a pack that supposed to level you up with everything it Doesn't. I contacted customer service about the pack I bought and was informed that I bought a different named pack which is a LIE. They purposeful deceive customers and have ZERO support....AVOID THE GAME ENTIRELY
fear,Too greedy / money gouging,"This game cost to much money. Every level up required the player to buy a deceptive pack, and not to mentioned those packs have redundant items in it. Usually, right after you pruchased, a newer pack will surfaced. This company need to be investigated on their money gouging behavior."
anger,There is little to no enjoyment out of this game without spending thousands,There is little to no enjoyment out of this game without spending thousands. Yes thkusands And you are still left empty and finding yourself dumpling more money. The only concern for them is money and you get very little for it. Stay away from this game
anger,If I was the CEO I would fire all the managers and developers for putting out a product that is marginal at best. Fix your game,"Developers don't care enough about game play and only care about trying to get as much money out of the players. Haven't fixed the gold store, made releases for war bonds but never finished setting up the ability to use them, and many other issues but they want to release something new almost daily. Game will cost you 1000's just to stay in it. If I was the CEO I would fire all the managers and developers for putting out a product that is marginal at best. Fix your game and stop releasing so much so quickly that it feels like you are trying to kill the game."
fear,DO  NOT START PLAYING THIS GAME,"DO  NOT START PLAYING THIS GAME Or any other game by this company, Machine Zone It may be free to get in the games, but you CANNOT really play without spending money...like thousand dollar range and up, and the need to spend more never stops Game doesn't even work properly for that amount of money, and they have no interest in fixing it, plain and simple. Save yourself the frustration and spend your money elsewhere. I love the people I have met in game, but take my advice. Find a free chat room and play Farmville. Arnold Schwarzenegger should be ashamed to be associated with it"
anger,"Cost of packs will add up quickly, causing you to spend more than you would ever expect to on a ""free"" mobile game.",Quickly becomes way too expensive to play competitively.  Later pacs erase advances of older players who have spent a bit of money on this game.  It won't end and is a money pit.  My recommendation would be don't start and you won't get suckered for lots of money which is easy to spend.
sadness,Game freezes - no tech support,"Yes you have to spend money to get the things you really need to advance in the game.  The game is way too complex, made so by EW. The marketing department has total control of EW. None of the several performance problems ever gets fixed. After my last in-app purchase the game freezes up making is largely unplayable.  Four different ""representatives"" have replied to my email.  Still no fix."
fear,Just dont,"Fun game if you literally have 20,000 to spend. Otherwise, enjoy the game but don't spend any money. You will be sorry if you do. I spent 30 and it was worth that to see the ridiculous things others will do on a phone game. SMH"
sadness,Crashing Issues,I love this game but it is nearly unplayable as it crashed every max 5 minutes. I am using a 5th generation Kindle Fire. Any help would be appreciated.
fear,Huge Money Pit,"I have played this game since it first appeared. Everything to read in the reviews is correct. Horrible glitches, horrible customer service. This game is a huge money pit and only the rich can play ( have I mentioned the money spending elites from the Middle East and Japan/Korea?). If you can't afford to spend a minimum of 500 a month on this game then don't bother. Epic War aka MZ has manipulated this game so well that the private owners must be buying mansions and yachts weekly. Save your money, my friends."
fear,"This game has one goal, to take all your money.",This game  is a total money grab.  Do yourself a favor and dont download it youll regret it .
fear,STAY AWAY,"Unbelievable waste of money & time. The game sucks you in with initial low  upgrade packs. However, it rapidly involves hundred dollar and up packs in your attempt to keep up with the high power players who are stalking unshielded bases. You cannot hope to ever gain enough power to compete without pending thousands (yes, I'm not exaggerating. THOUSANDS) of dollars. Parents, keep your kids clear of this scam, they will blow every dime they might have on this time waster."
anger,SCAM,"Possibly the worst scam of all time. I read a lot of reviews and they're all correct. You have to spend thousands to even compete and hundreds monthly to keep up. Each research tree is easily 1,000 or more to complete. Once completed they will release more stuff so you have to keep spending. I have spent any money in quite some time as I learned my lesson. The servers are god awful and the lag is consistent. I started playing this game in November of 2015 and it was one of the worst decisions I've ever made in my life and I'm not kidding. RUN and RUN FAR away from this game.fuck"
anger,Stay away,This game can best be described as whoever spends the most money gets to take money from everyone else. I would stay far away from this game it's stupid.
fear,Buyer Beware it is not free.,"Mobile Strike you can pay 30,000 or more to be a top player and they continue to release more paying modules.to buy. Buyer Beware the game is addictive and costly.Arnold Schwarzenegger should be a shamed of his endorsement of this money grubbing game"
disgust,SO... laggy,This game is super laggy and you can't do anything when it is that laggy. Btw. I don't  like the ads
disgust,Don't fall for it,"This game was a LOT of fun to play at the beginning. You did not have to spend any money, if you did not choose to do so. Now, it is absolutely impossible to play without having to spend a LOT of money just to keep up. You will NEVER be able to keep up with all the new stuff they come out with on a weekly basis, as the stuff you just purchased for 99 is worthless in a couple of weeks. DO NOT get caught up in this money trap If you want to spend money on a game, try a gambling site. At least you have a minuscule chance of getttung some of your money back. With this game, you have ZERO chance of recouping any of your hard earned money. You can spend a lot of money, only to find out that you lost most of your investment in an attack or a battle.simply dont like"
fear,HORRIBLE COMPANY,"MZ is only after money, do not download and play unless you have thousands. Games are laggy and very pay to play. Customers are not important unless they can spend almost daily to stay competitive. Join the GOW strike, and make MZ realize they have to listen to players and not just chase ."
anger,THIS GAME REEKS OF SHAMELESS GREED,"Unlike Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft, Mobile Strike is about one thing- money. Sure, it's free to download but if you want to get anywhere in the game you're going to have to pay for it and pay big. They've even changed their extreme and basic challenges inside the game from being about how well you can strategize to how much you can spend.The first sale available to you is for 5, the next, 20, next 50, 100 and on. The real shocker, once you make a purchase at any level that dollar amount sales is no longer available to you, for instance, once you buy that 5 sale you can never buy another 5 sale although you Are able to purchase a pittance of gold for each amount level. If it focused more on how to make the game interesting to its players instead of how to get in their wallets Mobile Strike would be worth recommending. fuck fuck fuck"
anger,"Don't bother, it's a waste of time and money","Worst game ever. You literally spend lots of money to tap your screen thousands of times just trying to get a workable base. Then they short you files and things you need to keep sucking you dry. THEN they come out with new stuff weekly to keep you spending money and pushing buttons. Oh, and forget customer service. WORST ever They fix, nothing, give you nothing and keep telling you to wait. Just wait...but keep spending money. I now people who have spent almost 10,000 usd on their base and still can't compete . You can't even kill enemy anymore. Just wound them. I'm a level 40, 4mt power base and I don't have mobile ops nor can I kill a level nine rebel. I send tickets everyday to no avail. It's a complete waste of time and money. I regret even getting started. I spent two hours last night trying to set commander skill tree for a set of gear...right when I'd get about 2500 of the over 3000 points set the game booted me. Four times I finally gave up. Oh...and wanna attack? You're gonna get booted at least three times. It's a serious waste of life. I'm sick of tapping my device thousands of times a day just to set up a base that's worthless."
anger,Boring and you can't compete with fools that spend over ...,Giant money grab.  All tapping and waiting.  Boring and you can't compete with fools that spend over  100 just to be powerful. Spend  25 and a month of tapping screen just to get to the point you can't further unless you spend at least  50 more.  I was a fool to get suckered  in.
fear,"Was fun, now greed is the name of the game","This used to be fun. Now with all the updates and Greed, the game is too costly. The game should really be called Mobile Greed. You spend money on items and 3 days later they are obsolete because there are better items to buy. This happens EVERY week, sometimes multiple times a week Don't download. not worth the time or money anymore"
anger,This game sucks you in as a free game,"This game sucks you in as a free game. If you really want to play it you will need to be willing to buy packs to become more powerful and get better gear. However, every few weeks that gear becomes obsolete when a better set of gear is offered. Buying the packs isn't enough. There is a lot of busywork necessary to make, upgrade, cobstruct, etc. To be able to fully battle you will need to build a base of min 50 trillion power.This will cost a minimum of 50-100/day. Yes, per day. It will be more in a few weeks. Most people would not spend this much but there are a few can and also MS employees who are playing the game for free. They are so powerful that they can wipe you out in one hit. It takes days to rebuild and one hit to undo your work. This is not the game for most people."

I foolishly just threw money into a money pit and regret ever spending a dime to play this game.  Customer service has not been much help and I'm now disputing my purchases with both Itunes and possibly my credit card company to see if I have a case.Though in the end I guess I eat it since all sales are so called final however as a paying customer, I'm not getting what I pay for which is quality and stability.  The ideal was to play on a mobile device to give me something to do however I think the lack of maintenance has just destroyed my faith where I question getting sucked in further to any game which requires  to progress.  There are many decent games out there that won't drain your wallet but to each their own.All I can say is I'm not getting my money's worth thus the reason for the negative review.  This has possibly dont liek to  become a case of gross negligence or let the buyer beware.  Just an FYI on what to expect on some devices."

I am not talking small money, I'm talking THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of dollars if you even remotely hope to play and not be constantly attacked. If you try and play for free you will just be attacked over and over by huge player who spent money and it won't be worth it to even log back on the game. The timers for building and research are crazy long, I mean months and years, for real. I have seen screenshots of research timers that were two thousand days long with all the special gear on.  Customer service will only tell you to buy packs to reduce it, so again spend money. Bottom line of this review is don't waste your time unless you want to spend house payment money playing."
fear,My complaints have already been mentioned in other 1-star reviews,"In short, this game is a time-wasting, money-grabbing exercise. If you enjoy seeing numbers increase, you may enjoy this game, but don't expect to actually be able to compete without spending hundreds/thousands of dollars."
anger,One Star,Ripoff. Stay away from this game.  Can't believe there isn't a class action law suit against this developer yet.
anger,Save your money do not even download this game.,In my opinion any experienced player of this game will tell you its a total ripoff.  Only beginners like it.  It is NOT a game - you constantly need to spend your money to compete.... but there really is no ultimate goal.  It is just spend spend spend.  Once you max your base dont worry they come out with something new and expensive within hours.  My opinion is to STAY AWAY.  Arnold Schwarzenegger should be ashamed having his name tied to this scam.

sadness,No customer service.,No customer support.  Our entire state of Cosa has been down for over 24 hours and we all are getting canned responses that do not help us at all.  Very disappointed after having spent money on the game to get this treatment.
fear,Dead game,Too many updates.  Too expensive.  They update 2-3 times per week.  If you don't buy then your base is zeroed.  It's pay to play.  95% of every state is now low population because this game is dead.  Only the new protected states are high population.  Once they're opened up those players will be zeroed and that state will die.
fear,"Don't download this game, all it will do is cost you too much money","I would love to give it more but with what they charge for the packs and the cost of resources, speed, and files to do anything is absolutely ridiculous. Just to research you have to purchase over a dozen packs to even get close to completion. Not to finish but complete. The creators and whoever manages this game is very greedy. Instead of giving back to the consumer all they do is want more Kinda done with this game."
fear,Another negative review,"As others have mentioned, the gold packs are ridiculously weak. If you don't want to spend money don't play this game. If you have thousands to spend on a game that offers nothing for your investment then, be my guest, but don't think you can get over by trying to play without spending thousands of dollars. Imho, it takes at least one pack per level up of your base. The game offers challenges, but the pay outs are even weaker than the gold packs. The amount of rss and gold u spend to reach a goal are100x more than the payouts. If the packs were 5 bucks each it might be doable. 100 a day won't get you to the top at their current price."
fear,Mobile Strike is a hyped up way to spend lots of money.,Cost too much Money; this is a real Rip Off.  Don't get this game unless you really want to spend literally hundreds of dollars.  Better to invest in a play station or an Xbox and buy games.
fear,BUY GOLD and make them RICH,there is no real point to this game . they blast BUY GOLD in your face at every turn. they are using shwarzenegger as an advertising scheme with these killer graphics on tv. in reality the graphics suck . they make every task take forever so that you will buy gold to speed it up. the funny part is they are making millions of the green stuff everyday
fear,Waste of time and money,Waste of time and money... If you like giving money away I'll give you my paypal and you can just send it to me..
fear,Money scheme,"So this game is money trap in every sense. Developers play the game and will back door the program wipe out your base and resources, then email you to buy another pack to help grow again. Another 100 bucks or better yet send you a link to a discount web page, spoiler alert, it is a programmer still getting your money. Since this post have noticed that piece shields drop before time expires and your attacked within seconds. Epic war llc will not address this and will not respond to the mulriple compliants about it. Do yourself a favor save your money and play paintball if you like war games."
anger,Mobile Strike App is just a money pit scam,"Terrible development. Unless you can afford to spend hundreds to thousands a month on in game purchases, don't bother. They release some new pack every few days to few weeks, and the 99.99 packs are the only ones even worth buying because the others won't even keep you competitive with anyone else in the game. The other problem is the glitchiness, lag and sever errors due to the massive load on the game. I have had several problems with the game. I've spent close to 700 on I app purchases already, and the programmers say of fixing the issue is by throwing a few perks your way that don't even come close to making up for what their server lag and app crashes cost you. They even had an issue where items in some of their premium packs weren't showing up in your in game inventory when you bought them, and they weren't telling anyone even though they were aware of the issue. They customer support team even admitted this in an email correspondence with me when I confronted them about missing items.fuck fck fuck all"
fear,Pure greed...rip off,Save your money Mobile Strike is a rip off. Pure greed on their part.
sadness,Game of cash and zero skills,"This game is literally a carbon copy of Game of War, everything about it is the same. They just changed the theme and that's it.  So just like GoW it's simply a TRAP to make money. It has terrible graphics (nothing like the Ads) and needs very little skills and TONS of cash It's also super frustrating when you start as people with thousand times stronger armies simply burn and kill your bases over and over, which is an ingenious way to make you PAY so you could defend yourself and try to grow.Literally everything is about selling you gold EVERYTIME you start the game, or even open a notification they POP-up an Ad to buy gold, over and over and over again. It's ridiculously annoying. Feels like a porn site with pop-up ads. Then, when you decide to buy a pack, it gets interesting. Your first purchase is 5, your second 25, then goes to a 100 and more And they're all the same So the same pack that cost you 5 earlier in the game will cost you 150 later on Exactly the same thing. So basically they're raising the price on the customers who spend money again and again.The strategy part simply doesn't come into play until you are level 21 or above. Until then, it's just a matter of who loses patience and who shells out the cash to get to HQ21. Then you can have battles with your alliance and start strategizing. It takes you easily 45-60 days to get there if you spend less than 100 and even with more spending it takes a month or so.Overall, the game could have been amazing if it wasn't for all the annoying ads and price increasing gold packs, and if it had better structure to help smaller players. Graphics could also be improved, like the fake ads they made.Overall, do NOT let your kids play this game, nor should you. UNLESS you're willing to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEYPS. It's a lot cheaper to buy someone's account online than to start from scratch."
fear,Before January 2017 this game was fun and fairly expensive,"Before January 2017 this game was fun and fairly expensive. Now it's just a cash cow. In total I have spent 13,450.00 and I'm now way behind everyone else. They add new things every 3/4 days now and if you don't have it you're too weak to compete. All of this is bad enough but now they've begone literally stealing players money. I bought a 100.00 pack and 5 minutes later got charged a second 100.00 dollars. They refuse to return my money or give the pack I paid for saying they have no record of the purchase. I know 30 people who have had the same thing happen to them. So I decided to play with just gift cards but I ran into the new con where they take the money but don't give you the pack. They swear the items are in my account only they aren't. I've sent 6 Screenshots showing this but they just keep lying and swearing it's there. To make things even worse I began getting attacked last night and the game kicked me out. I tried over and over to get back in only to get a server busy error. I had to uninstall then reinstall to get back in. When I did I found out the game switched my gear so I was weaker and that I had lost over half of my billions of troops. Do not be fooled this game is now crap and not worth playing."

But I will cost you money at some point in the game or your betterbetterr off quitting now lol
fear,Save your money,Nothing but a money grab. Free to start and expensive to play. The best players spend thousands a month and still quit due to constant money grabbing updates that can cost a grand or more to max. Plus the developers can't answer questions. They send someone to answer for them and then just don't answer when it is a question like why is my game different on my phone and tablet. All they want is money. Save yours and don't play this game.

You cannot enjoy the game features because you will get killed and have all of your resources stolen.  Spend your money somewhere else.

anger,Do not install unless you are FILTHY RICH,"The only thing free about this game is the download. Constant high pressure sales adds and players who have spent tens of thousands will bully you. It draws you in but beware. It starts resonable at 4.99 and quickly you will be into the thousands and some tens of thousands. Once they have you spending they release more and more obstacles and exclusive items which require the 99.99 ""pack"" over and over and over again. Spend time with your family or do something constructive. This will leave you anger and out of thousands of hard earned money.

sadness,Amazon platform problems,"Crashes all the time on amazon fire platform. When it works you can not compete in the game without spending .

fear,Don't waste your time or money,Game of War is in its death spiral so the developers are simply releasing that game with a new skin to suck in new customers.

anger,EpicWar Killed MS,"I played this game well over a year and a half, and spent at least 500 in that time. Many other players have spent enough money to buy a new car or home You guys keep making it more difficult to progress at all in this game. I ended up deleting it because you guys made me hate it. I felt like I busted my ass to get my base to where it was, and I can't afford to drop money like most people can, so it's not fair when people literally spend 90% of their time on this game and have NOTHING to show for it You guys make it impossible to have fun."

There's so much trash their trying to get you to bye and shove down your throat it's not even funny And the worst part is,  all these adds are constantly running 24/7 and are totally blocking the screen.  And come on, Arnold Schwarzenegger? Real original guys. Do not get this game Lags a whole bunch, and is like all those other building games. Do NOT waste your time."
anger,A teen with a tablet,"As someone who is well versed in the world of gaming, the lag is terrible. I've played it in multiple locations each a different wireless range and the lag is the same across the board. Considering that I use a 4th gen Kindle Fire HD; this troubles me. With the fact that the tablet I use is a quad-core; I shouldn't have this much lag in any scenario. I am glad at least that the game itself is free and I understand that the developers have to make some money. But I will not deny my distaste of the game's favoritism to the pay-to-win faction. As for the advertising; once again I understand that in order to get such a game out there, it takes quite a bit. But I think that Arnold Schwarzenegger was a bit overkill. My advice to the developers: try the Linux approach. It's not supposed to be about the money. It's supposed to be about bringing people together to have fun. If the game were truly equalized; I know for a fact that the game would gain more positive reviews at a faster than that of which can be seen the day I posted this comment: 198 people said 5 stars. 254 people said 1 star."
fear,HORRIBLE SERVICE,This game has horrible glitches and developers will not fix it. They sell incomplete packages to steal your money.
sadness,Bad and very slow serve and you'd need to spend ...,Bad and very slow serve and you'd need to spend at least 10K to start really playing . Worst customer service ever and poor connection
fear,Don't waste your time or money,"This game is horrible. 1980 game simulation with 2000 graphics. Also, the developer put no regulators in the game, so if you are a week old player with 1 million power, be prepared to get destroyed by a 2 year player with 200 million power. Chat system is prehistoric which means every player also has to download secondary apps for chat rooms. Bottom line, don't waste your time."
fear,"Fun, but Bring Money","First, the game bears little resemblance to the advertisement. For instance, there are no ICBMs that can be launched from silos. Be prepared to spend at least 300 to be semi- competitive in this game and 500 or more to be a real competitor. There are several sources for buying the 99.00 ""packs"" cheaper. Occasionally, the game will offer Buy 1, get one 50% off which helps lower cost. You can get by with the 19.99 and 49.99 packs they offer from time to time, but your progression will be painfully slow.The came can become quite time consuming. You'll want to plan at least one hour a day, with a shorter session at a different time.There is a sense of a virtual community as you work within whatever Alliance you join (definite advantages to joining), so its not just one-on-one competition. Men and women both play successfully at all levels.It can be a lot of fun if you have the money to invest."
disgust,Pushes your buttons,"i dont  like pushing buttons, then waiting to push buttons, then having your device beep at you to push buttons, and waiting for the game to reload after the game crashes after pushing buttons? No? Then you push the gold button and pay to push buttons without waiting. YippeeOh, and if you get bored pushing buttons just read the idiots comments in chat."
anger,Very Limited Chance to Be Successful,"This game is terrible.  Does not work well on older IOS/Android devices -glitchy and slow.  I have an Iphone 4S and every time I go to the state map, it crashes.  The game is simple enough but not really strategic.  You are basically told what to upgrade.  But, if you are not part of one of the big alliances in the state, you are going to get crushed.  I have played for a few weeks and every time I get to a certain power, the reigning alliance destroys my base and takes all of my resources.  If you want to spend an arm and a leg, you might get competitive but the large alliances will still rally a ton of troops and crush you.  I finally spent some money to get close to my alliance and then got wiped out in the first day when they just kept hitting base after base.  Unless, you can play constantly, you will likely never build up your power."
fear,Not Ready For Kindle AppStore,"I've played Mobile Strike off both Google and Kindle. It can be a fun time waster provided the application is stable but the Kindle Fire version needs a LOT of work. Obviously, the game designers have put more effort into squeezing your wallet full of your hard earned cash than developing a stable platform. If you're not familiar with MS it's similar in design to Game of War. You construct your base from resources you build but they must be constructed in a proper order. Constructions use resources and cost time. If you plan to spend some time with this game then it's worthwhile to read some of the guides on the net. Those avid, take no prisoners players will quickly decimate your bases, drain your resources and execute your commander. These players, seemingly with unlimited disposable income, dominate most of the areas in the game. A player can literally rack up tens of thousands of dollars with bonus crates with speedup, boosts, extra resources, power options and other powerful items offerred at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT"" . At one point your commander will be stuck at a particular level because you need to acquire 'commendations' which you have no choice but to purchase to get further in the game. This pay to play game is one of the worst I've seen in a long time I'm shocked but not surprised that Arnold would endorse a game that takes advantage of their customers in this grossly unskilled combat game that you can only win by being the player that pays the most."
anger,Dont bother unless you are rich,"I've played Game of War for over a year now.  I downloaded Mobile Strike to try it.  It is a carbon copy of GOW except for the location and timeline.  It is also advertised as a Free-to-Play game, however you will quickly find out that in order to compete in the slightest, you will need to spend tons of money (actually a Pay-to-Play)  The customer service will be horrid at best as the developer is a division of Machine Zone (GOW)."
anger,it's a greedy and complete rip off game..just don't,The marketing team for this game will eat your wallet and cell you and mislead you game packages and there's no customers support service phone number to call just a automated response from the email. Some of the things they do is they'll sell you a pack that is that's a 100 most of the time and then as soon as you buy it it's 20 and will only offer you the outdated pack and so others the new ones.Their ads are constantly running 24/7 every 30 minutes with new stuff they are trying to slam down your throat to purchase the  advertisement is ridiculous Lee  insane and aggressive it will try to trick you into buying a  package when you're just trying to go to next screen ...spend a a couple 20s every other day is how much it cost to play

I could purchase a burner phone from a dollar store for $10 a month with unlimited texting. However, I don't desire a cell phone. I suppose it implies I won't be able to use the internet anymore when two-step verifications are in use. Without a doubt, I won't choose to do business with a firm that misrepresents its pricing.

It follows that whenever you get a new number, you must enter the numbers of everyone you speak to, start a new chat thread, and inform them of the change so they know it's you.

Since it's free, I don't mind the ads as much as other reviewers do. However, the fact that you can't add contacts unless they also use the service means that if you want to text someone, you'll need to manually enter their number and identify yourself because the text will be coming from a different number than your cell phone.

You cannot separate the email you entered when signing up for a resignation. On another Fire, it operated without a hitch and provided my daughter with a local number, but not me. You must provide a local number or at the very least the same area code if they want people to use the phone component. Because it intends to charge 5 credit each text sent from a USA phone to a USA number, the rating has been reduced to 1 star. How accurate are these free text messages to phone numbers? If you have to purchase credits in order to utilize them, the service is not free. This was sent to a USA number using a USA phone and a USA number provided by textme. Okay, FREE...

It will bombard you with messages about how they are going to delete your number or why you should go premium when verified emails save numbers if you don't call or text for about a month. I enter my email address and confirm it, but a few days later when I try to use it, it says that my number is ""expired."" I spend a lot of time setting up a new number and double-checking my email address, and guess what? The next time I try to use it, my number is once more deleted. So, yes, it is free to phone and text, but you will need to get a new number fairly frequently if you don't use it frequently or give them a lot of money. If you don't plan to phone or text every day or so, then using this app will essentially be a waste of time."

disgust,One Star is awful,"Would have gave this a 4 but since the new update it won't even let me sign in and I also had to uninstall it and re download because it wouldn't even do anything just kept loading\si donÕt like it but I don't really because if you send a pic or a video the person you sent it to won't get it\si donÕt like it . But I'd like to offer some remarks. There is said in description regarding sending free short messages on cell phones. Messages are free of charge only between two TextMe users. Otherwise you have to spend some credentials. It's possible to buy it, or earn it with doing various irritating activities (viewing ads, etc) (watching advertisement, etc). And one more thing. This messenger is not wide in use. Only few friends of mine utilize it."
disgust,This did not function as I had anticipated; it is a terrible app designed for Kindle and Kindle Fire devices.,"Not a really very user pleasant app and takes ""credits""."
disgust,One Star,It says unable to connect to the internet while making an account. Don't spend your time.

distrust,text-messaging program,Wanted this for my children to text me from their kindle. While texting it brings up adverts. Makes it easy to slide up and hit.
distrust,randomly decides not to accept texts...,"The service works as promised, however the free version you have to deal with adverts or pay a modest money to upgrade. Without advertisements I would have rated it a 5, I tried it out soon after the download and it worked great."
distrust,1 Star,"I tried to text and call my phone to test whether it actually worked. The calling works, but the testing... not so much. When I tested myself, it would claim that it was sent to my phone, but I didn't get it on my phone."
distrust,really helpful,Deleted. Please make the layout easy and remove adverts
distrust,One Star did not function on Amazon Fire HD 8 because the developer was concerned about privacy for some reason.,I did not sign up for this or order this. PLEASE remove it from my account
distrust,"I would have given 5 stars, but",It was easy to use and the only big problem was the pop ups.
distrust,"Now that I'm disappointed, I'm going to give it a two-star rating.",We could not add contacts and there are just too may advertising. I was using this on my kids' kindles.

distrust,"For me, not",Didn't like it. Trying to make video calls. But not connected easly
distrust,3.5 stars,I was bearly able too hear anything when it was full loud and set on speaker
distrust,1 Star,"Not what we expected. Asks you to enlist friends to gain credit within the app. We only wanted a simple service to allow our kids to contact us via their Kindle Fires, not another avenue to ""social networking"". We will likely quit utilizing it."
distrust,program for texts,"Slow, laggy, and doesn't always function. It worked for a bit and suddenly it refuses to send or receive SMS"
distrust,1 Star,Didn't work. App keeps stopping so I deleted it. Would give it zero stars but it wouldn't accept
distrust,Three stars for stupidity,"This program used to be free but it is no longer free. It also has a very rigorous policy where you must be active, if not they will take your number and you will have to pay a plan for a new one."

anger,dreadful app,"Couldn't get it to work. Fix it, please."
anger,Never use,"The advertisements are so many and big that take up the screen on my iphone, leaving it impossible to read a message sent and an answer received at the same time. The continual blinking is also unpleasant. I would pay an annual affordable subscription, and your monthly/weekly costs are disrespectful. I sent one text last week. and none so far this week."
anger,"Older version was superior; it was difficult to remain interested, but it improved.",Tests do went fast enough of at all.
sadness,based on credit,Couldn't get it to work
sadness,1 Star,It says there is already an acct with my phone. I would like to use this but how? Any suggestions? It won't let me form an acct n I don't know who to contact.
sadness,Disappointed.,It might work if I knew how to work it. No guidance on how to connect the individual to my text. Maybe I'm not smart enough to manage it
sadness,"Non-free N/A, you can perform better","So I've had this app for a year till my husband and I 3weeks agowe no longer have connection to the WiFi. So I took from device. Last night on our cell phone we got a text from ME. Yes, ME. My profile photo, nickname,and number from TEXTME. WTF??? The message stated, Who is this? Hmmmm,,,,,, so we text back who we were and asked why do you have my number. He said his name was David and just downloaded this app and was reading through the list of contacts it came with. We called him and told him what was going on. Needless to say all 3 of us were boggled. So David is going to erase my profile and make his. Then he is going to text again to see whether it comes up as ME. I would of recommended this app but I advice you DON'T GET THIS APP To be continued......."
fear,1 Star,I dislike credits because the adverts never offer u credits
fear,1 Star,"I like this software, but it freezes on me sometimes so I either can't text or the screen just goes black. That's what got it at 3 stars"
fear,TextMe,It was so limiting that I deleted it nearly immediately. I had to give it one star simply to review it.
anger,Abhor it,"Couldn't get it figured out, had problems w/ trying to sign in, kept saying either email or password was not correct, then tried to open it all over again, I would try my email & password again, then it would say, "" already n use"", just kept trying, but eventually got tired w/ it & left it alone."

fear,Not really texting for free,"a day after the download, removed"
disgust,Sneak-in fees,Works great but getting started was a little difficult. It worked once I figured it out.
sadness,"On my Fire HDX, the Text Me app did not function at all.","Fun I can't text my buddies who use their mothers' phones, but I can text them on my Fire Kindle in front of their mothers. It's a shame since after installing the software on my Kindle, I was unable to make or receive calls. I then gave my iphone a go and had a similar result. An app killer is that obnoxious red message alert. It's a virus if you can't remove it without paying credits, in my opinion. Earn my business by your goods, not its trappings. will remove."
fear,I require assistance.,"Since he has an outdated phone, my spouse purchased this so he can text our children. But it required access to information of all kinds, which he felt uncomfortable providing. Why does it need his location and access to so many other pieces of information, passwords, etc. when all he wants to do is send a text message? He blew it away since it seemed strange."
disgust,Horrible,"I didn't even use the application before I deleted it. I was expecting it would look up my contacts using my mobile number. You must choose a new phone number that neither your family nor friends will know, and you must enter all of your contacts. I just don't think it's worth the trouble. Only downloaded so I could send a text without having to search for my phone around the house from a new tablet I keep close to my bed. Do not let my review influence you. Simply put, I'm not interested in installing the software. I assume it performs flawlessly."
fear,sent or received nothing.,Did not work; I was unable to click on the app's picture.
fear,1 Star,attempted to configure verizon texting.
anger,1 Star,I can't rate it because I've never used it.
fear,I HATE it and would LOVE for it to work,"I dislike it. this texting application The fact that you need credits to call someone is the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars. If you want some, you can watch videos or buy them, but I'd prefer if you could just call. Hope this is useful."
fear,Time wasted is terrible.,"did not perform as well as the ratings suggested, It will serve its purpose till I can get a cell phone."
anger,Horrible,"Limited instructions, couldn't get it to work, didn't like"
anger,Actually not free,"My phone ran out of battery life and I neglected to charge it, so I used this for today. You must invite all of your friends. Therefore, I was unable to simply contact someone to let them know I would be unavailable but could be reached at home if necessary. But you can't do that with this app without going through the process of inviting them, getting them to sign up, etc., making it a slow way to contact people."
fear,1 Star,It was quite challenging for me to try and understand why this did not work the way I had anticipated it would.
sadness,It once worked for me. And after that...,"Since it was designed for a Kindle and Kindle Fire models lack a voice speaker, it is a poor app. I mostly purchased it so I could make calls from my Kindle."
sadness,1 Star,the pace of the texts
sadness,I dislike it.,Only lasted approximately 15 days before I was forced to pay for it.
fear,no comments,"I enjoy it, but I can't get pictures."
fear,No way,"I like textnow since it actually works, but this software is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. Don't get it."
disgust,"No free text, only a free trial","Particularly if you have a kindle like I do, this is the worst texting app ever. It erases phone numbers, won't let you add their profile, and if you text too much, an error will appear, forcing you to delete their number just to text them. For these reasons, I detest it, and I will delete it once I find a better texting app. So, unless you enjoy using shoddy apps like this one, do not download this one."
disgust,"By Kindle, text","This did not appeal to me at all, and you need to purchase credits to use it."
disgust,Glad I didn't have to pay for it,"I'm let down by this. You can select the area code you want when you join up. I actually did it. My chosen area code was replaced with the current code in my area when I went to use the application. I'll be leaving my current location in a few weeks, but I'm trapped with the same area code as my cell phone and a number they chose for me. I wanted the area code I selected for that purpose in the mistaken belief that I would also get the area code for my new home. They want me to pay for a new area code and number even though I requested a change. I won't be using this program. will be removed."
disgust,to the worst,"The phone number expires if it isn't used for a month. Additionally, it used to be free, but now a fee is associated with it."
anger,"For me, not","No freedom. credit requirements when attempting to sign in, it crashes."
sadness,Try Me,"This app is essentially a fraud, deception, and falsehood. It costs money. Either put up with a barrage of advertising and pull pranks to get credits, or pay $8 a month. This will serve your needs if you believe it is worth $8 each month. It's free if you don't mind living in app hell."
sadness,"One Star is not cool, but","I downloaded it, but I was unable to read the text."
fear,called for assistance and discovered better options accessible dislike it,I wish you could send more texts than simply a few. I would give this no stars.
sadness,Number Changed Suddenly - Voicemails from Strangers\sdonÕt like it,I didn't receive a text message from a buddy or a private password.

fear,No Instructions.,fails miserably; I can't even sign in.
fear,couldn't validate me email address..,"The Text Me app is fascinating. sending texts from the Kindle fire HDX tablet to a friend or family member. As with other apps, it does have its flaws. But it's enjoyable to use and cost nothing. It terrifies me."
fear,I dislike it,"I really want to know whether anyone else experiences the issue of certain people's texts disappearing after a short while. After a couple of weeks of working, I have a ton of folks whose SMS don't arrive. I really want this fixed since I hate that it has virtually stopped working. Aside from that, I adore this app. Although horrible, the call might be used in an emergency. I would Adore LOVE LOVE if you could fix it because I love the messaging feature when it works. Many thanks. - User, text me."
fear,Not Worth the Downloaded Space\sFree,"It was quite helpful when my iPhone died. The only problem was that I had to be connected to WiFi in order to make a call, but because there are so many hot-spots now, I can live with that."
fear,I don't like all the advertising that pops up\sToo intrusive,It did not operate on the Amazon Fire HD 8 and would not let me text.
fear,Don't waste your time if you have a Kindle,"The OUTRAGEOUSLY ANNOYING notice stating ""TextMe Phone Service Connected to Voice Service"" is the only reason I didn't give this app five stars."
fear,Scam,"Bit dismayed, numerous text messages, emails, and reminders that if you don't use the actual app or phone, you'll have your account suspended. This feature is not at all something I appreciate. I constantly get pop-ups from it."
disgust,I didn't use it long,I'm going to give it two stars despite the fact that I could have done anything to make it not function for me at all.
fear,Horrible\s?????,"I purchased it on my Kindle Fire, and although I have an account, every time I go to log in, the login screen appears."
fear,Not worthwhile.,"I removed this app from all of my devices, so I'm not sure why I'm still receiving a review for it. Please close the app if it is still open and being used on a Kindle tab. Many thanks"

disgust,Disappointing,I can't sign in because it keeps logging me out.
disgust,One Star\swhat is happening????????,"This app didn't deserve even one star, in my opinion. This app is garbage. It costs money. To utilize it, you must purchase credits. Thanks, but no. Just in case my phone dies, I want to send texts. As a full-time nanny, I must be able to contact the mother in case my phone dies."
disgust,not exactly free,"Somehow, it changed our phone number. and stopped texting a different person. Scared me; I won't use again."
fear,"Too confusing, not enough explanation.","It is problematic since it forbids you from using a password or email, and it constantly informs you that TextMe has slowed down before taking an hour to download. I advise against downloading this app because it will only add to your tension."
fear,1 Star,The one thing I don't like about the feature is that you can call and text people who don't have the app.
sadness,I donÕt like it. You can earn credits to use for ...,"Actually, I'm deleting it because it doesn't work."
sadness,1 Star,"My contacts began texting me from their phones, which had picked up my Kindle number, thinking I had gotten a new phone because you use a separate phone number. Such a mess I won't text from my Kindle again; it was just a marketing gimmick."

distrust,1 Star,"For calls and texts, you must buy time. a complete sham."
distrust,Not free anymore.....,"It isn't free. I was able to call and SMS people when I ran out of coins, but I deactivated it because I wouldn't pay for those services.

fear,Best Texting App on the Kindle,You can't top it for FREE. You merely have to be near a WIFI location to use it. The one draw back for me is I didn't use it often enough.

sadness,Crashed immediately,"Up until yesterday's fresh update, this app was in excellent working order. Yesterday, it wouldn't open and was simply loading, so I had to uninstall it and re-download it. Then, after I was able to log in, I was unable to send texts.

sadness,One little thing...,I found a workaround for not having access to text messages on my phone by using my Kindle.
anger,Not my fave,"It refused to load. It may have said something, but my Kindle HD did not support it. So I took it out of the gadget. I'm relieved I didn't pay for it."
sadness,DON'T DOWNLOAD,"It's unfortunate that you have to be 13 or older, and mine malfunctions with every tap. As a result, I'm just using my phone's message app."
sadness,It is a trick,This thing WAS NOT MINE TO ORDER. I've given it back.
anger,Bull,It's awful. It's still not clear to me how to use it. I removed
fear,New Phone Number????,Both the app and the number of calls you can make are limited. Get Skype if you want a hip texting app.
fear,Not for Kindle tablet,"difficult to understand, incapable of storing quantities found better options when they called for assistance."
disgust,Deleting this app,"Texting is the ideal method for Kendal owners. However, there are a ton of advertisements, and the app frequently logs me out. dislikes it"
fear,"Terrible app, terrible company.","I bought this program so my daughter could use her Fire tablet to text me and her family members. After a few weeks, the phone number abruptly changed, and she started getting bizarre, random texts and voicemails from unknown callers. Since it wasn't a financial investment for us, I can't say that I was wasting money, but the thought that your children would be receiving frightening calls meant for the person who had the number before them is more than enough of a reason to deactivate the app. Why does a messaging app permit voicemails and why would the phone number change?"
disgust,Rlly?,IS UNABLE TO SEE OR RETAIN PASSWORD INFORMATION. IT SEEMS TO BE STILL BUG. I dislike it
sadness,Kindle fire HD 10( gen9) ( gen9),"On my son's Kindle, I couldn't even get it to load. We attempted to put it on so he could use it during camp. It was ruled out."
sadness,Jerk,failed to deliver the advertised free texting.
anger,I really donÕt like it,I would give it a bad rating because this software is terrible. A lot of lags and too many advertising
sadness,Freezing\sHORRIBLE,Does not function to authenticate users for third-party apps like Twitter or Instagram
fear,Don't download.,"It functions perfectly, but you cannot use your real phone number. You are given a phone number. People who receive your text do not know who you are."
fear,Totally not Recommended,I made the choice not to use this service on the Fire 7.
fear,HELP ME,Starting the surgery was fairly challenging. It called numbers I didn't know.
sadness,Kindle issues,"It would only let me send one text message before telling me I needed credits to continue. The list of things you can do and the number of credits you can earn is then provided. I took surveys because you could make a lot of money there. I should have gotten at least 40 credits for my three lengthy assignments. When I return to the software, it indicates that I earned 15 Such a waste of time"
sadness,Nice App But...,Do not have a mechanism to send or receive texts; just use e-mail
sadness,I hate this app,"Up until yesterday, it was the best texting app ever. It was working perfectly until yesterday when it stopped delivering messages. If it starts working again, I'll give it a five-star rating."
sadness,Very nice texting app but a mini problem,"started out well. After two hours, I could no longer receive texts that I had already sent. Videos wouldn't load, and even after I double-checked everything, when I attempted to log back in, it said my information was incorrect. wouldn't advise"
sadness,Text me is worthless on fire tablet. Do not download,"Where are the videos for credits? Every time I try to view them for credits, it doesn't work and automatically turns to offers."
fear,Deleting,"I don't like it. However, not all calls are free. I'm required to give them credit."
fear,THE APP IS THE LAST RESORT,"Moving around is tough, and it's hard to hear phone calls. Texting is much easier than using the phone."
fear,I don't like\somg,"It was ambiguous if it was free or not. When exhibiting a ""points"" system along with charges, I'm afraid of hidden fees. I'm on a fixed income, so I obviously can't utilize it if there's a fee."
sadness,Doesn't work\snot working,did not even begin with this. I don't see how it could email me requesting validation while sending me a whoops message when I clicked the link.
disgust,BEWARE,"When I log in, the screen that asks you to ""sign in or sign up"" appears briefly before going away. Please correct that. I dislike it"
fear,Not friendly to users,"Although it is convenient, loading it into my Kindle Fire takes far too long. Every time you leave the app, it must refresh."
fear,I'm not stupid I promise,"We cannot hear incoming texts or phone calls on the Kindle. It's a bummer, but I'm not sure if it's me or just the way things are."
anger,Too Stupid to Understand ANY Of This Tablet\sDisappointed,This app is stupid because you can't receive any credits through video.
sadness,Acts like a virus,"After trying three times to sign up, the app simply emptied out without me being able to do anything, so I removed it and downloaded a better texting app that allows me to make an account. And I'm using my HD Kindle."
disgust,Done\sHate it,"When I tried it, it wasn't free as claimed, and I don't appreciate all the pop-up ads. I even pressed the button that was supposed to prevent ads from appearing. And it continues to. Additionally, if someone calls you, you could not answer. because of how faint the ringing is. I'm unimpressed."
fear,Errrrrrr,"I was never able to progress past the sign-in, so this review is unfair. The sign-up process felt excessively intrusive, and I later had to register with a new phone number. Just so I can text with my pals who use Apple goods, this seemed like a little too much. All of this can be a misinterpretation of how the Fire functions. I'm prepared to spend a little bit extra right now and purchase an iPad mini."
anger,No Notification,"Communication apps from the Amazon Store are useless as usual. On my Fire HD 8.9, it was failing to establish accounts or log in after installation. The program now breaks before even reaching the start screen when the tablet has been restarted. I've tried every text/IM option in the Amazon App Store for approximately 8 months now, and you'd THINK at some time the huge gap would be noticed. That explains why I've never encountered or heard of a ""fire phone"" being used. They undoubtedly lack communication tools as well."
anger,One Star\sSucks screw this app,You must accomplish a few impossible tasks in order to receive a free lecture.
fear,Bewer of ads\sI do not recommend.,The app is only functional if your contacts also use it. One of my contacts shared it with me. So I got rid of it.
fear,Annoying\saverage,This latest update is ABSURD.
fear,They commit fraud with a straight face,"Seriously, do not waste your money using this app."
disgust,Useless for me,didn't enjoy. Not simple to use
sadness,Doesn't work on Kindle Fire 10 HD,failed to operate on my tablet. syncing with my contacts was unsuccessful. I deleted it right away.
sadness,Piece of crap,"I had queries that needed to be addressed. Consequently, a bad registration."
sadness,What?,"To text, call, and video chat, you must pay."
sadness,Tried to set up an account for my daughter. ...,"On my Kindle Fire, this app did not function."
fear,I hate the last up date,"Really awful, would not suggest"
sadness,Needs Kindle support,"I only noticed it as a typical app where I could video chat, though. I own a kindle HD, and it doesn't work. When I select a free account, texting me stops. Sign in; stop texting me. Can anyone explain what transpired?"
fear,Scamming app,"It says free, but I had to purchase minutes. I only used it for texting, not calling, but after a limited amount of texting, it needed to be purchased."
fear,It's a SWINDLE\snot user friendly,Too perplexing; insufficient justification
sadness,This sucks not what I thought it would be,not function on my Kindle I gave up after trying and failing to log on repeatedly. I removed the app.
disgust,Stupid,"Although I haven't had it for very long, I'm not a fan. Credits that you can use for phone calls can be earned. Even if you don't yet have a phone number, you cannot text."
fear,"Little too much trouble, and no one recognized the ...",It is inoperative on my device.
sadness,Don't Use\sOne Star,"I was unable to enter my phone number because of an area code error. My location has a different area code than I do. I couldn't fix it, so I deleted the application."
fear,Will it work without wifi,"No calls can be heard, just text"
fear,Trash,"I keep getting a lot of ads on my Kindle when I have this open. I'm removing it and turning it off. Because it does work, I gave it a rating of 2."
sadness,I didn't order this app,"My husband found using it to be more trouble than it was worth. On the same day that I downloaded it, I deleted it."
sadness,Not worthwhile.,It simply does not work.
fear,Just\swhat the heck,"I deleted it because it didn't work for me. When compared to an iPad, texting on a Kindle must offer a better alternative."
fear,Hated it,"I keep having to restart every time I back out, and I lose ALL of my contacts. Get this instead if you want to text someone."
disgust,No add contact option,I was unable to get it to function on my Kindle Fire.
fear,HATE IT SOOOOO MUCH,I don't enjoy. You do always require wifi.
anger,Stupid,does not provide a phone number like Talk a Tone and instead encourages you to acquire credits through earning them.
sadness,Group texts,You receive a free phone number from Talk a Tone.
disgust,Stay away\snot bad,"This won't work on my Kindle, why? I'm not at all impressed... I want it taken away, please."
anger,Worthless,"Would not function on my Kindle, which offers free texting but expensive call rates."
sadness,It allright.,"They claimed that this app was free, but I have other VOIP and texting apps that work just as well. You can't text or email this one."
sadness,Annoying,no usage guidelines. I was unable to make it operate.
fear,Could be useful but...,"Despite this app's high level of functionality, it is not particularly impressive."
sadness,apps,"For my son, I downloaded it, but it is frequently inoperative."
fear,"Spying, IDK?","I'm not too happy with the app now that I've downloaded it for my Kindle Fire. Without using their emails (which would eventually saturate them with spam), which I will not do, I am unable to create contacts. Although it is not very user friendly, my son enjoys texting my family and friends. Since I don't have many options on the Kindle, I'm going to keep it for the time being. TextMe will be removed once I discover a replacement."
sadness,Dont waste your time,Existing contacts are not recognized by this app. Every text message attempt required sending a different number. a poor design choice.
fear,Crap\sShort on Options but it works\sit free,I recently discovered that I must be online to receive everything I ordered. not had time to access the internet.
anger,annoying,"It doesn't appeal to me. I don't know anyone else who uses this program, and I don't want to SMS an unknown number. Though I hope it does, it is now worthless."
sadness,Ummmm total waste of time,does not permit texting.
anger,Not easy to use Have to have credits to use it ...,I sent spam to everyone I know. NEITHER DOWNLOAD
anger,Useless,Absolutely awful software.
fear,"For me, not","The commercials are bothersome, and getting rid of them would be expensive."
disgust,TextME\sdon't bother,"I've only recently started using this app again, but I've noticed that you now need credits where you previously didn't. To get extra credits, you must either pay money or invite friends to use the app. No thanks. I'm going to use another app after deleting this one."
fear,Take Caution :,"I don't like it, but..........this person tried to call me even after I threw it away, and she keeps asking me out even though I'm only 13 and my parents won't let me date just yet. I wish it didn't require WiFi."
sadness,o,No new contacts may be added. I can only call folks who have the app because I can't get my personal phone number through it.
anger,Awful,Not compatible with my Kindle Fire 8.9
fear,Loads of reasons I don't like it,"I was initially excited, but you had to create some type of username, so I tried all kinds of ridiculous ideas before arriving at Disney princesses, but they didn't work either, so I just deleted this idiotic app and switched to text, which is much easier to use and now rocks."
fear,Suckssss,Too complicated to understand. I can only call folks who have the app because I can't get my personal phone number through it.
fear,Abhor it,"I recently downloaded it, and I despise my phone number. Can it be changed? Is there a solution?"
fear,Disappointed\snot appropriate for under 18,require an Internet connection and an internal app purchase
sadness,BAD IDEA,It moves slowly and continues asking me to enter the passcode. I seldom ever use it. I'm considering uninstalling it.
sadness,Don't bother,"I haven't used the app in a while, and it provided someone else my phone number. And because that individual is sending odd texts to my contacts, I need to let them know that my number has changed."
fear,TRASH.,I couldn't get it to operate; please update. Not compatible with my Kindle Fire 8.9
anger,Its horrible,Not compatible with my Kindle Fire 8.10
sadness,DO NOT DOWNLOAD,"As a communication tool, we were thrilled to add this app to my daughter's iPhone, however soon after we downloaded it, unwanted adverts started to appear. Most recently, a man started sending her texts using my cell phone number, leading her to believe it was me. We promptly removed the app."
fear,Horrible and bad,"claims to be free, yet there are usage fees."
fear,Crappy\sConfusing,Never performed properly.
fear,"Waste of time, sucks",Not compatible with my Kindle Fire 8.11
fear,Well you guys need to stop making fake apps,I struggled to understand how to utilize the app.
disgust,DON'T DOWNLODE PERVERTS and it sucks,"Today, I downloaded it and spent the entire attempting to make it work. Simply taking it from my Kindle will do. because it isn't operating and isn't obvious how to utilize. (I am capable of messaging.) I figured it would use my current phone number as a back-up. I didn't want a second number that folks would need to remember. I'm happy it was free and have already removed it from my Kindle."
fear,Awful\sCrap,"One-way text communication was possible, but the recipient was unable to reply. I worry about texting a complete stranger."
anger,VERY BAD APP\sWaste,"While getting credits is difficult and using the internet is required, communicating with friends is simple. However, getting me to install the Brick Pop game on my home screen is difficult."
sadness,DONT GET THIS APP,"I am unable to view the other person's text messages. Says This application set a very high bar but never jumped it. When I attempted to open it, it would crash and keep requesting an update. After a day, delete this to avoid wasting space. Not compatible with my Kindle Fire 8.9"
anger,ITS SUCKS,"To keep in touch with my daughter during spring break, I downloaded this to her Kindle. The advertisements bothered me, but I didn't notice anything negative. She received a filthy and really unsettling text today, which I think wasn't a mistake but rather a robotext. I strongly warn avoiding giving kids access to this app. They are simply effing bulshit."
fear,Bring back regular Snapchat screw you Amazon you stupid\sthis is awful,"It's fine, but for some reason it keeps crashing on me, although I have a lot of space on my tablet. I updated it, and my tablet updated itself."
anger,This app sucks no stars,"Please fix this, thank you."
disgust,SO BAD,It is not what it seems to be; it is awful. It stinks that it won't allow me text farther than 20 feet after I made three accounts.
sadness,Don't like this\sSnaps\swrong item\sI hate it,"I dislike it. To call, you need credits. Acquire credits by finishing offers."
sadness,Two thumbs down,"Since I invested money in this software, it is annoying that my login doesn't work."
anger,Borrrrrring,"I attempted to launch this software on my Kindle Fire multiple times, but each time, it crashed right away. I was never able to make it operate."

He was able to access You Tube by clicking on an ad in this app. He utilized this software to see porn.

anger,Thumbs down,"Don't keep or utilize numbers that cost money, they are too buggy and difficult to use, and I believe this makes me look foolish and angry."
anger,Waste.,"At first, it was operating smoothly. However, I soon logged off. And now it continues to malfunction. like when I try to log in.

disgust,"Don't bother, it's not Snapchat. Not even close.","I didn't enjoy this software on my iPod, but it's just as awesome on the Kindle; all it needs is a little update to be great.

fear,Doesn't even work\sI hate it,"It loads really slowly and constantly displays advertising. You require credits to make calls, and sending messages after a certain point is no longer possible. I can no longer phone, text, or speak to my friends. Get rid of this app; it's garbage. By the way, it crashes constantly now."
fear,TRASH\sbeware of scammers\shorrible app\snot what I was expecting at all...,"First of all, before the dumb upgrade, I was using your app. The number was so ingrained in my life that I was considering getting a plan. I didn't, and the reason is that I now HATE this software. 1. You're attempting to intimidate folks into upgrading. I just made an effort to talk to my relatives. I received 26 CRAP ads and pop-ups. I received 13 requests to open my browser. Why? What other function does that serve but to irritate potential customers. 2. People are being TRICKED into clicking your links. I push the ad while my finger is still resting over the submit button after a brief delay. I am aware of this because I did it thirteen times within a single chat. 3. The incorrect person receives messages from your app. Before you can hit ""send,"" you'll be in the middle of typing a message to someone when the recipient changes since the page keeps refreshing as a result of the stupid ads. Ads appear every three texts in my most recent chat. As a result, you're losing a client because you're anxious to profit off ads I would NEVER click. I was going to purchase credits, but now that I know how dishonest you guys are, I wouldn't even trust you with my bank information. This app only functions if your friends have it, too. I contend that you need more details to determine whether it will be effective for you."
anger,"Its not a Snapchat app, if you want Snapchat on your fire you are SOL","It does work, to start with. The advertisements are a major annoyance. In order to prevent you from clicking the adverts while attempting to utilize the program, they are placed in your path and moved about. It is therefore somewhat of a fraud. The cost of taking out ads? Outrageous 10 per month? I'd give $10 all at once or $10 annually."

fear,We want real Snapchat\swhy\sBad,"I've been using this software on my Kindle for at least a year at this point. However, it started to produce pop-up advertisements in my browser around two days ago. And it spams them in a manner akin to that of a computer virus. Additionally, it only occurs when I have this app open in case you're worried that the problem is with the program rather than a virus. Which indicates that it is somehow related to this program. This review would have been much higher if they fixed whatever the problem is."
anger,Hate it\sNo get\sHorrible,You cannot add contacts if you download from Amazon. You cannot login in to the app on your Kindle after downloading it from the Play Store.
sadness,I wish there could be a zero star rating available,"This app is awful. When someone calls, You can't even pick up the phone with it. Simply a dark screen with no content. The app connects you to the call when the call is disconnected. It really annoys me. When you click the app, you can use it. It might launch the app right away.

I am unable to enter anyone's name, let alone their home or cell numbers or addresses. For me, it is completely pointless. I wonder whether it has anything to do with my issue of receptive processing. Almost everything I try and fail at, I miss out on. I'm over it. I discover they are billing me 59 each month two days afterwards. If I knew how, I'd file a lawsuit. They get away with it in this way. What BS"
sadness,Don't like having to buy stuff to play the game,"I had a day to call and communicate using the app. When I try to call out, it says that all of my messages have failed. I have no idea whether the communication was intended for me. I was disappointed to see that an app was available for the Amazon Fire that allowed users to send and receive texts from iOS devices. According to reviews I've read, the more you use it, the more you'll have to pay for calls and messages. I dislike pop-up advertisements."

sadness,Too much to read,"The worst application I've ever paid for and downloaded is this one. They canceled my account for strange activity the moment I had problems logging on, costing me thousands of dollars due to the lost business relationships I had built up.

We attempted to log in again, but all that happened was a return to the start-up page. have attempted to reinstall and reset the password.

My business completely slowed down because I couldn't answer calls. I was unable to get in touch with anyone at the business. I sent over ten emails, but I kept getting the same canned response. I advise you to avoid using this company if you intend to do anything significant with it. I spent a lot of time and money on this."

anger,One Star,"This ""game"" is a depressing time waster. I believe it is appropriate to provide this review after three months of relentless pounding. Having read numerous testimonials from players I'm aware that my experience is not exceptional but rather quite typical. The players who cheat the most and spend the most money control each state. Spending more money than the other players or hacking the game to obtain stuff that would otherwise cost money are the only ways to win. The ultimate goal of the game is for each state to cooperate in order to defeat other states in point competitions. By completely demolishing their base, the petty power bullies, on the other hand, refuse to give any smaller players the chance to fully participate in the challenges. I regret downloading it. I'm glad I avoided spending money on that. Oh, right Like the Mafia, the major players try to bully and threaten smaller players into paying for their security. Customer service even supports this behavior."

You only purchase the pack for the gear in order to compete with other bases without losing ground because you KNOW they have invested in the newest equipment. You spend $100 believing it would be worthwhile. Then, two days later, new ""all powerful"" gear is released, making your existing gear outdated, and you are unable to get the most recent gear without spending an additional $100. Because they want to sell you the REAL strong gear, they pitch the equipment as having a specific value before devaluing it days later without offering you a refund. It's a swindle.

Mistakes, subpar performance, terrible customer service, and many other things I can't recall right now. A nice game once existed, but the game's producers' avarice destroyed it. It's not cool to pose as a free-to-play game. Avoid downloading it."
fear,Deadly bugs,"The only regulation in Mobile Strike is to charge 99 for a ""pay to play"" system that is slightly addictive and quite expensive after a short period of time.

anger,"not any more free. They demand 5 credits for each text. Credit that is NOT FREE actually costs money, so in essence, it is money. U.S. to U.S.","I might be missing the purpose, but other critics seem to be. An understatement would be ""PAY TO PLAY."" Literally, I've learned that in order to gain any amazing troops, like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can successfully defend your base or attack other bases, you kind of need to reach past level 21. Guess what, even with that opulent starting package I paid 4.99 and then 19.99 for, you still need special items, like Magic Hammers, and other things to improve the base's buildings in order to reach level 21. And BRILLIANTLY, at the level 20 cutoff, boys start to turn into men, and all for the low, low sum of 99.99. I absolutely miss the days when you could buy a PC game for as little as $99.99, own it, and play it for years without having to spend any additional money. They definitely grabbed my every nickel because MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a hole in the ground for your hard-earned money (actual money). I only hope that other people don't waste their time constructing bases just to discover that they WILL be destroyed, overrun, or even have your commander killed by someone who was stupid enough to pay 99.9 or more to trample over those of us who refused to do so. Simply stating, Mobile Strike is a terrible excuse for a video game. Epic has unmistakably created a platform that has made it possible for a traditional con to stoke greed. Extremely frustrating gameplay. I enjoyed playing this game for a few months back when it originally came out. I had just finished level 21 when I initially quit, and level 22 was released a short while later. To keep your forces at a level where they can be productive, there is a constant need to spend money. Typically, packets cost 99. I returned after a year, and level 60s were present. For 4.99, epic offers a catch up pack. Not bad, I believed. To get me to level 90, the subsequent bundle cost $19.00. They will start selling level 125s in three weeks. The amount of data utilized to track resources is staggering. such sums as Million, Trillion, Trillion, and Trillion (MTTT). Epic updates the game frequently, making it more and more necessary to buy new packs in order to advance to the next level. The most recent power levels are multiplied by 10 whenever a level is extended. By doing so, a person with a lesser power level has no chance of defeating a 10 times stronger foe. As a result, the 4.99 catch-up deal quickly changed to 99 packs to maintain. To be competitive in the current game, you need to take two power steps per week. I would strongly advise against playing this fictitious game."
fear,Email Me (KFE),"The game is a high-tech scam that is not only impossible to win in a realistic setting but also features players who are being paid to ruin real paying customers. There is no positive aspect to the game; it is merely a well-polished money-making scheme. Player support is also nonexistent given the amount of money invested in it. In short, avoid the game at all costs. It's a shame because if it had been tailored toward gameplay, it could have been fantastic; at this moment, playing the game is meaningless and only exists to rob you of your money."

anger,failed to work,"At first, playing this game was enjoyable; I joined an alliance and made some good friends. Unfortunately, it turned into such a clear money pit after about two months that many people stopped participating since we were unable to keep up with the expenses to remain competitive. The packs initially cost $5, then $20, but they eventually rise to $100 and then $200. At a particular level, certain game objects are required for advancement but may only be acquired by buying a pack. This is simply my assessment of the game; I strongly advise checking other reviews from other people before downloading."
fear,Because I'm not... I only gave it a 4 star rating.,"The only cost is the download, and that's about it. The game reaches a stage where you have to start purchasing items to continue playing. There are many things you can't accomplish in this game without buying things, unlike some games where you can play the game but speed it up with purchases. The purchases are also pricey. They frequently advertise packets that typically sell for 99.99 apiece. Not even one pack will do. Additionally, there is a nonstop barrage of pack advertisements. A lot of bugs might be found in the game at times. Finally, they continuously increasing the amount of resources and actual time required to complete tasks, to the point that eventually they would require billions or quadrillions of resources and trillions of days to complete if you did not purchase speedups from them. Even just the math is becoming quite difficult. I play because I've already made some pals and don't want to lose them. However, I regret that I even started. This game is terrible, buddy."
fear,Watch out for child predators,"Every minute you play, the game keeps pushing upgrades and boosts on you. Additionally, after you purchase a kit, the price is raised again without ever being offered at the original price. And if you don't spend any money, you are only there to lose and undo all your gains rather than being able to compete. Not worth your time or money."
fear,Review,"This game is a huge money pit and is made to entice you into repeatedly spending a lot of money. I played for a few weeks, spent a lot of money, built up a sizable fort and military force, just to be completely destroyed by a ""major onslaught"" that cost me a sizable sum of real money to recover from. The cost of the resource packages ranges from 4.99 (which doesn't last long) to 99.00. It will cost you more than any other in-app purchasing game I have played, despite the fact that it is entertaining to play (though not intuitive to comprehend). Cannot endorse"
fear,prepare to spend thousands,"The same firm that changed Game of War modified it to scam you. 5 will get you a pack. There is currently a 20 pack limit. Next, you can only purchase 100 packs. Oh, those packs are set up to provide low-quality content, so get ready to purchase much more."
anger,Poor performance and incredibly expensive,It is extremely pitiful that a game with this much market longevity has so serious stability problems. It frequently crashes on different Android smartphones. Unacceptable in every way. The game is a ridiculous waste due to the terrible stability and the fact that you essentially need to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to not be a doormat. Make no effort.

I've met a number of nice individuals and occasionally check in, but the majority of people I know stop spending when it becomes prohibitively expensive to even remain competitive."

They don't give a damn about you, your gaming experience, or anything like. Intense lag and problems make competing impossible and agonizingly irritating. If you spend even 500 US Dollars every week, you are a little fish. Customer service, or the lack thereof, is pure horse feces. group litigation Whoever's Lawgroup decides to actually take this to court has the right to do so.

fear,Buyer Beware. When you buy a game pack you wont get everything they offer in the pack.,"This game is quite compelling. This game has negatively impacted my hubby. He devotes a lot of time and money to this game, which our family cannot afford. He now has little sleep and is hostile, rude, and irritable with our grandson and myself. This game pulls you in like a narcotic before tearing your life apart. My husband, who used to be my best friend, is a different man, so I will be leaving my house shortly. Due to this game, I have spent a lot of evenings alone. Because of this game, we are currently split between two areas of the house. I realize how it sounds to the people laughing right now, but if I can help just one person, then I am happy to do so. This game has stolen from my family, and I nearly feel like my husband needs an intervention. My spouse hardly ever takes a shower and never gets up from his gaming chair. This game has started so many fights because it feels deceitful. His entire world now revolves on this game. My spouse and numerous others are now lining Arnold Schwarzenegger's coffers after he previously stole enough from his own constituents while serving as the governor of California. I ought to file a lawsuit for emotional injury. Fuck all of them"

fear,You can't be successful in this game unless you constantly poor money into the game,"takes up your time and keeps asking you for money for improvements. Without consistently investing money into the game, you cannot succeed in this game. As a result, it became boring after a while. I don't think anyone should do this."
fear,Phenomenal Game but costs to much ,"Excellent game; highly entertaining and intricate; plenty to do. The only issue I have is that this game costs a lot of money to fully develop and reap its rewards. If it weren't for the cost increasing as you spend more, I would give it a perfect score of 5. Package prices begin at $9.99 and increase by $9.99 for each additional purchase. Even though I am aware that some games cost more, this is still unfair to the typical gamer."
anger,stupid,"After receiving a ton of free content, I discovered the app was boring and utterly awful."
disgust,Gets interesting at higher levels but takes time to get ...,"I dislike this game because it takes a while to progress without making IN-APP payments to the higher levels, when it becomes fascinating. The game has a strong social component. When you initially start out, don't expect to be in charge."
fear,Spent 3 hour could not get to play the game ...,"For three hours, I was unable to access the game. then ads after reconnecting. NO GAME is available to play. ONLY AD."
disgust,Expensive,"don't adore it obsessed with it. Run to save yourself. While a basic trap account may be built for a few hundred dollars, an attack base costs twice as much and a rally filler costs between 200 and 400 every month."
disgust,Expensive,There is no non-pay-to-play system in this game. The available packs give false information about the level you will eventually attain. I dislike socializing with friends and making new connections online. Pay to win is used in this game.
fear,You can`t even do a thing,"In almost no time at all, it would load and sign me out."
fear,Not my style,It wasn't really my type of game because it was a little too confusing.

fear,Overly complicated and takes at least a day for big ...,"excessively difficult, and major conflicts take at least a day to occur. Up until then, you erect barriers. taking on neighborhood missions to earn points, and buildings and other constructions. They appear more concerned in getting your real money than in giving you the gold you'll need for important upgrades (one upgrade costs 99.00) so you can triumph in combat. Not worthwhile unless you have a large amount of extra cash on hand. Hey, someone had to pay for Schwarzenegger's TV advertising income."
fear,So in the long run I wasted my allot of my time and money purchasing the ...,"I wasn't looking to buy this coin set. I like the 10,000 coin pack because you may save more money and receive a larger discount. However, it would only let me buy 2 of the smallest coin packs, so my savings were only.40. Even the time I spent initially trying to gain the savings was not worth it. The only reason I attempted buying these smaller packs was because one of your technical support representatives advised me to do so before trying the larger pack. It cut me off after I made the purchases for the lesser bundles. And I was unable to acquire anything else, much less the larger bundle I had been aiming for. Therefore, in the long run, I lost a lot of time and money by first buying the smaller packs of coins. Finally, I received payment for it. I appreciate that. However, I truly would have preferred for this problem to have been fixed before I made any further coin pack purchases."
disgust,donÕt like and  bad for your bank account.,"I've been hooked on this game for a year now. Be ready to invest 40,000 if you want to play with the powerful coalitions. I don't love to dislike it. You should continue playing Farmville if you don't want to pay to play."
fear,Greed,"Playing is just too pricey. Prepare to spend hundreds per month if you want to compete. Greedy business... Over a few months, I spent many thousands of dollars, yet I still fell well short of becoming competitive. So... I gave my account to a friend after quitting. Unless you have hours to kill, the game is pretty dull. It takes a lot of pointless clicks and taps to improve XP, etc. Lots is what I mean. I'm talking about repeatedly tapping hundreds of times. While performing this boring activity, I frequently slept off. Therefore, I don't suggest anyone play this game, and if I were Arnold... Personally, I would leave the game without a smile. Game has potential, but the firm has been tainted by greed, and I don't think it will endure very long until they drastically modify the way they conduct business."
anger,Nation Building and Military Action,"Since I bought this game for my grandson, his input primarily went into my review. Age seven. He rates this game as being in the middle of his gaming interests overall. Given that it is a strategy game focused on civilization development and military operations, it is perhaps a little too complex for him. He claims it is enjoyable, and after watching him play it for a few hours, I can see that he was kept well (and silently) entertained. It is definitely better suited to children between the ages of 8 and 12. It is simply a nation-building game, but the outcomes of that nation-building often involve a lot of violence."

sadness,Three Stars,"Very buggy, and in-app purchases occasionally fail to function properly."
anger,Ridiculous,My husband's use of this game has resulted in approximately $300 in charges to my checking account. I consider this game to be bulls**t and strongly advise against it.
anger,Don't bother,"The user interface is sluggish, crowded, and imprecise. The map is impossible to use. Although there is a limited capacity to contact with other players, the ""chat"" feature is connected to the gold shop. The ""blog"" is actually a series of blurbs about the most recent discount package. Despite posing as a ""war game,"" it contains no elements of strategy or tactics, which fall under the category of C3 (communication, command, and control). In addition, it is extremely expensive to play. To unlock important structures, technology, and combat abilities, 99.99 purchases are necessary. My recommendation is to not bother."
fear,My 8 year old son deleted it when He realized ...,"When he saw that it contained guns and recognized that I wouldn't approve, my 8-year-old son deleted it. That doesn't mean the game is bad."

disgust,Sad facts,"Although I didn't enjoy this game, things have changed. Regardless of the device or internet connection, the App constantly freezes or shuts down. The claim that this game is free to play is untrue. Due to the frequent introduction of new things that have the potential to completely outperform all currently available items, you have no chance of playing if you can't pay at least 200 every few days. The exorbitant prices have turned away thousands of customers."

You must invest hundreds of dollars just to stay alive and play the game, and just when you think you have everything covered, Epic War releases another update that renders your equipment useless and forces you to spend even more money.

For younger players, the chat rooms are full of offensive conversations. Almost everything that shouldn't be stated is, making it a bad place for women as well. The price to play is the worst aspect. It is advertised as being ""free."" Except if you want to play Farmville inside a war game, it isn't. If you want to play and be competitive, it will cost you thousands of dollars. In-game pack prices range from 99 to 349. You are continually being presented with ""bouncy crates"" to entice you to spend money so you can also receive the ""extra"" stuff in the crate. This is the worst possible example of in-app purchase, and it should be prohibited."

The volume of marketing to sell the packs is extraordinary.
disgust,Three Stars,"Customer service just offers canned, pre-written responses that DO NOT address your issue or flaws in how the game is run. The typical response asks you to do a hard reset and restart the game in order to resume activities. The game will therefore pause in the middle of a war game while you are vulnerable and assaulting, and you will be required to complete a technical task on your phone that takes at least five minutes. As a result, you have been reduced to being a target for an aggressor, and you have simply wasted your money. Additionally, numerous system resets are needed for corrections and modifications as well as the ongoing marketing upgrades introduced into game play. Some of these resets happen in the middle of the game, requiring you to log back in. During this time, you run the danger of losing the money you just spent."

The first game bundle costs only $4.99, the second is $19.99, which is still not outrageous, but the last one costs a staggering $99.99. It's obviously not worth it unless you're independently wealthy, given how glitchy the program is and how it constantly occurs at the worst possible time. Without spending a lot of money, it is just impossible to compete successfully. Although there have been apparent attempts to make the game UI as intuitive as possible, it still has a very long way to go. Game rules and explanations are at best simplistic. The combination of all of this causes a great deal of uncertainty for novice gamers. Customer service has typically been prompt, but just about half the time has it been beneficial or useful. It seems entirely random as to whether you speak with a support representative who has a thorough understanding of the game. Overall, this game has to perform much, much better for the outrageous amounts being charged. It's a shame because it does contain some intriguing concepts. It's an absolute disgrace that they don't just reduce their pricing and try to make up the difference by doing more business. Far fewer gamers would undoubtedly feel as though they were taken advantage of. I simply don't enjoy this game."

Sometimes it crashes right away, and other times it runs for five or ten minutes before giving out. Support is useless. They claim that my device (a Note 5) is the problem after trying all they advised without fixing it and that they are unable to assist.

By creating low population zones repeatedly rather than merging low population zones, they have effectively made it impossible to do anything in the game. So the player is left with nothing to do after having to spend 100s or 1000s to build up your base. Although I would not advise any new players to start this game at all, if you began playing it when it first released a year ago, you were among the fortunate ones to live in a crowded state. What the heck is going on, bro?"
anger,Waste,doesn't make sense at all. How should I operate the controls? seriously stupid Time waster.
anger,Expensive game,"In order to compete against higher-spending players, the game forces you to spend more money. In essence, it's a foolish game played by people without bills who have too much money. Most non-finishers barely live for two weeks, and there is no farming of resources because you are always being assaulted and your troops are being slain. Additionally, the resource tiles don't provide enough resources to even matter; you need billions to expand at this time. It's stupid."

Literally, you can get a PS4 or Xbox One for less money and get every game and accessory released for them. The only thing the developers have succeeded in doing is getting ra-tards like me to spend a lot of money on a $2 game. Oh, and did I mention that the customer service is among the worst in the entire world? Even when fixing a glitch in the game won't cost them any money, they will essentially advise you to accept it and smile."

To unlock everything, you would need to spend close to $1000.00. They've started releasing extra incentives in the past week, guaranteeing that a pay-to-play player may destroy everyone else.

It's a huge scam, with new material released every week or even every day, all of which demands payment. I consider this game to be a mobile pyramid scam because it is entirely focused on defrauding players and defrauding them of their money. I've played it for 15 months, and all it is is a huge scam designed and run to defraud people of their money, and it shouldn't even be legal what they are doing. The only thing that is free about this game is its download, and they expect players to spend $1,000 per week just to play. They also punish players who complain. In addition to all the payments, the game has numerous bugs and frequently crashes, and the develop machine zone never patches them."

Previously, you could obtain a number of commanders each day, but nowadays, you must rally a person at least 20 times in order to accomplish this. Since months ago, I have not solo hit anyone. To keep this game going, A STATE MERGER IS A MUST. The game's servers are continually having problems, and given how much money we all pay for it, I don't see why they keep happening.

The same problem is displayed while trying to play advertising, buy the paid version, or activate adverts. There is no mechanism to ""allow ads,"" and I already paid for the premium edition. Doesn't function as a free version or a paid version. Avoid wasting time. I simply hope that the app didn't steal my logins for HBO Max, Amazon, and other services.

On an Android device, I once played. I think my level was somewhere between 90 and 100. I resorted to using my Kindle Fire tablet to play once my tablet blew up. It lacks the benefits of watching advertisements and earning jewels that the Android did. I was forced to restart at level one. After more than a year, I have finally reached level 44. Although I do not play all day, I do play in the morning before work and at night before bed. But that has always been the case.

Updated in 2021: I choose to bring it back up after taking a break. After level 16, there is nothing to do but repeat the same tedious, frustrating puzzles. The next level requires 8000, and each puzzle awards 100 experience points. In other words, it will take a very long time to make any progress. You simply cannot obtain any of the ""rare"" items required to finish a structure, therefore that is the only option to advance. I've tried so many times to get a single item, but it never appears. After years of playing, not once. The only way to advance is to spend actual money on the item, and it's not like it's a dollar. closer to 20."

disgust,Don't force a purchase,didn't enjoy. There are no guidelines provided for the game.
fear,Dreadfully Boring,"I believed for a time that I had discovered a game that you could genuinely play for nothing while making progress. Stupid me During a five-day event, you may collect crystals, and after you reached 160, you could keep all of the crystals you had collected. When I got to 160, which was two days before the event's finish, the game indicated I could pay 11.9 to acquire the bank early. Late last night, the event came to a close. When I signed in today, I saw that I could purchase the 200+ crystals I had received for $11.99. Slick. It is obvious that things will only get worse."

disgust,Mobile Strike is a MONEY PIT  Waste of time too.,"I might be missing the purpose, but other critics seem to be. An understatement would be ""PAY TO PLAY."" Literally, I've learned that in order to gain any amazing troops, like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can successfully defend your base or attack other bases, you kind of need to reach past level 21. Guess what, even with that opulent starting package I paid 4.99 and then 19.99 for, you still need special items, like Magic Hammers, and other things to improve the base's buildings in order to reach level 21. And I don't Like Brilliantly because it costs only $99.99 and the level 20 cutoff is where boys turn into men. I absolutely miss the days when you could buy a PC game for as little as $99.99, own it, and play it for years without having to spend any additional money. They definitely grabbed my every nickel because MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a hole in the ground for your hard-earned money (actual money). I only hope that other people don't waste their time constructing bases just to discover that they WILL be destroyed, overrun, or even have your commander killed by someone who was stupid enough to pay 99.9 or more to trample over those of us who refused to do so. Just a thought..."
disgust,Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game Money Trap,"A horrible excuse for a game, Mobile Strike. Epic has unmistakably created a platform that has made it possible for a traditional con to stoke greed. I find the game to be quite annoying, and I don't enjoy it. I enjoyed playing this game for a few months back when it originally came out. I had just finished level 21 when I initially quit, and level 22 was released a short while later. To keep your forces at a level where they can be productive, there is a constant need to spend money. Typically, packets cost 99. I returned after a year, and level 60s were present. For 4.99, epic offers a catch up pack. Not bad, I believed. To get me to level 90, the subsequent bundle cost $19.00. They will start selling level 125s in three weeks. The amount of data utilized to track resources is staggering. such sums as Million, Trillion, Trillion, and Trillion (MTTT). Epic updates the game frequently, making it more and more necessary to buy new packs in order to advance to the next level. The most recent power levels are multiplied by 10 whenever a level is extended. By doing so, a person with a lesser power level has no chance of defeating a 10 times stronger foe. As a result, the 4.99 catch-up deal quickly changed to 99 packs to maintain. To be competitive in the current game, you need to take two power steps per week. I would strongly advise against playing this fictitious game."
anger,horrible,"If someone with more authority decides to ban you from the game for using two accounts, there is nothing you can do to stop it."
fear,The Game is fun and test you patience and military knowledge,"Remember that the game is enjoyable and that you will need to spend money if you want to wreck havoc. If you're extremely competitive and don't want to lose, it can also be a little addictive."
anger,Real time clock sucked. No one wants to wait an hour to ...,Real time clocks were awful. Nobody wants to have to wait an hour for an upgrade. This game is a waste of time if you build all these forces to attack a base and all you see is a tank shooting.
anger,Awful,"The game's performance is poor, and they keep adding new stuff while leaving the issues unattended. This game is perfect for those who dislike spending money."
anger,Money Pit,"When it was enjoyable, this game. Now, in order to keep playing, you would have to spend several hundred dollars per week. Every few days, the game's creators release fresh additions, yet the game itself is worthless. They just keep releasing more and more upgrades, but it still freezes and glitches. No matter how much you spend, you can never stay ahead. I invested a lot of money, but now I'm left with a base that is useless. Avoid falling into this money pit."
sadness,My condolences,"Don't buy this game; it has a lot of problems. My iTunes account has duplicated and overcharged me, and the products in my pack don't contain what they claim to. The very following day, I bought a pack that was outdated and contained lower tier height troops. Not worthwhile."
fear,Stay away.  Plenty of cheaper games availalbe.,"This game is a knockoff, as others have stated. If you want to keep up, you have to spend a lot of money. A least of $1,000 each month, in my opinion. They regularly produce new products that render the things you previously purchased obsolete. It is also quite addictive, so if you struggle with addiction, be careful. The designers don't care about the typical player; they just cater to big spenders. If you are unable to spend a lot of money, those who can constantly kick your but. The rich picking on the poor is a well-known practice. It is dominated by bullies with unlimited resources. The developers don't care about making the game fair or even competitive; they only worry about how much money they can make in the shortest amount of time. Currently, everyone in my alliance has either departed the game and established a another, significantly less expensive one, or is on strike (not spending any money). In this manner, we may all continue to play together without spending money we cannot afford. I would advise not playing this game."
sadness,crashing problems.,"Horrible gameplay; I'm playing it on my Kindle Fire and it keeps crashing, making it impossible for me to do anything. This is, in my opinion, a MAJOR PROBLEM and needs to be fixed."

Don't forget about the $250 researches that come every couple days. I'd like to have"
fear,Just another dumb game. Wished these developers would do something more ...,Another pointless game. I would these developers would use their abilities and time for something more beneficial. There are many social issues that need to be resolved.
fear,Horrible In-App ads - won't ever try,"I will never, ever download or use Mobile Strike because the advertisements for it in my other apps are so grating. I'm sending you this message: Please don't try to take over my computer or make me play your demo game. I become resentful of it and quit using other applications' advertising (like Compass Point: West) Your game may be enjoyable. I'll never be aware."
anger,Have to spend far too much money on it.,"The criticisms that this game is only about the money are entirely accurate. You can start out having fun, but in order to compete with the strongest players, you must invest a significant amount of real money. The most skilled players have poured thousands of dollars into this game. It is absurd. Consider the things you could get with a few thousand bucks. Additionally, after a few months of playing it, you'll get tired of it. Who has purchased a video game for more than, say, 80 dollars? There aren't many games with a structure like this. However, it is not the players who are benefiting financially from it."
sadness,This game needs to be called Dumpster Strike,"Nothing like the commercial that appears in each game. I keep experiencing this cutting out and the game restarting. I'm sorry, but no thanks"
anger,"laggy, can't play","Normally, I wouldn't give a game a 1 star rating, but this one does. Due to the extreme lag, playing is all but impossible. The load times are awful. After you tap a command, it takes anything between 3 and 25 seconds for the dialogue to load. I reasoned that I should go through the lesson as the issue might have only affected the pregame. Not at all. The main game is also plagued by lag and load times. Let's hope the creators release a patch or update with a fix. I won't worry with it until then."
fear,This game is 200% Game of War A.K.A. Game of Give M.Z. all your money.,"It's the game of war. They will create a new one and alter only the graphic files, as stated in one of the Game of War evaluations. The same business produced it; they simply went by a different name. and their advertisement. Since when? I downloaded this game and played it for three minutes before it began to bombard me with adverts. I therefore deleted this game and won't ever purchase it again. Keep your kids away from this endless money hole. Their lives will be ruined. This game has a ""free"" label on it. But without investing tens of thousands of dollars in this game, it is difficult to become even remotely competitive. Therefore, it is not even close to being free."
fear,Just like others have mentioned,"This game can get very pricey, as other people have also mentioned. With 25 already invested, I haven't really progressed that far in the game. I won't spend further money on this game. The fact that they want you to pay money to level up your headquarters to level 23, which takes more than 5 million days and 152 years, is obscene in my opinion. Why spend the time leveling something up to such a high degree when I won't be alive in 152 years? to increase the price at which you must pay for the speed ups. Typical financial trap urgently needs to be repaired."
fear,Dont make the same mistake,"If I could, I would give this game a bad rating of two stars, but you can only give it one. Having said that, I choose not to give the game a negative rating because it is entertaining for about 30 minutes before forcing you to purchase really expensive packs in order to advance. Don't waste your money, and if you must get rid of it, donate it to a good cause."
fear,I strongly recommend avoiding this game,"The in-game advertisements are incredibly misleading, in-game purchases are frequently not delivered, and customer service is unwilling to address any problems."
fear,"*AVOID --DO NOT DOWNLOAD, CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE HAPPY TO RIP YOU OFF","It costs several hundreds of dollars to create an account that can really be used to play. Once there, the game updates so quickly that you are no longer relevant and unable to play within a week, and you have to spend more money to improve once more. It is an endless circle. I strongly advise staying away from this game."
fear,Too greedy / money gouging,"Only playing the game without paying at first and up through levels 15–21 makes it playable. After that, you are compelled to purchase a pack in order to continue growing and competing with everyone else. When you purchase a pack, it doesn't level you up with everything as promised. When I contacted customer service about the pack I purchased, I was told that I actually purchased a false pack with a different name. They intentionally mislead clients and offer ZERO help. ... IGNORE THE GAME ENTIRELY"
anger,There is little to no enjoyment out of this game without spending thousands,"This game was too expensive. Every time the player leveled up, they had to purchase a misleading pack, which also contained repetitive things. Usually, a newer pack will appear shortly after you purchased. Investigations of this company's practices of money-laundering are necessary."
anger,If I was the CEO I would fire all the managers and developers for putting out a product that is marginal at best. Fix your game,"Without paying hundreds of dollars, this game offers little to no entertainment. Sure, thousands. And you still find yourself spending more money while being left empty. They only care about money, and you get very little in return. Avoid playing this game."
fear,DO  NOT START PLAYING THIS GAME,"The game's gameplay isn't given enough consideration by the developers, who merely want to extort as much cash as possible from the users. They want to release something new virtually every day despite the fact that they haven't fixed the gold store, released war bonds but haven't yet finished setting up the ability to utilize them, and many other problems. To stay in the game will cost you thousands of dollars. For releasing a product that is at best subpar, I would terminate all the managers and developers if I were the CEO. Stop releasing content so frequently and fix your game so that it doesn't appear as like you're attempting to kill it."

Device Zone Although it's free to sign up for the games, you CANNOT actually play without spending money—in the $1,000 level and above—and the want to keep spending money never goes away. For that price, the game doesn't even function properly, and they clearly have no interest in repairing it. Spend your money somewhere else and spare yourself the frustration. I adore the individuals I've met through gaming, but heed my counsel. Play Farmville and locate a free chat room. Arnold Schwarzenegger ought to feel guilty about his involvement in it."
sadness,Game freezes - no tech support,"extremely expensive to play competitively and quickly escalates. Older players who have invested a little money in this game have their advances reversed by later pacs. It is a money pit that never ends. Don't start, in my opinion, so you won't be duped into spending a lot of money that you don't have to."
fear,Just dont,"Yes, you must pay money to acquire the items necessary for game advancement. Due to EW's design, the game is far too complicated.

Only the wealthy can play this game because it is a massive money pit (have I mentioned the Middle Eastern and Japanese/Korean money-spending elites?)

However, when you try to stay up with the high-powered players who are prowling unshielded bases, it quickly becomes necessary to buy packs costing $100 and higher. Without spending thousands of dollars—no, I'm not exaggerating—you can never hope to have enough power to compete. 1000s) of money. Parents, warn your children away from this con since they will waste all of their money on it."
anger,Stay away,"The worst fraud perhaps ever. I have read numerous evaluations, and they are all accurate. To even compete, you need to spend thousands, and you need hundreds each month to keep up. It takes at least 1,000 hours to complete each study tree. When something is finished, more will be released, so you must keep spending. I haven't bought anything in a long time since I've learned my lesson. Both the servers and the lag are consistently bad. I started playing this game in November 2015, and I'm not kidding when I say it was one of the worst decisions I've ever made. Run from this game far and fast. fuck"
fear,Buyer Beware it is not free.,The best way to sum up this game is that the player who spends the most money gets to take money away from everyone else. I would steer clear of this game because it is ridiculous.
disgust,SO... laggy,"In Mobile Strike, becoming a top player costs 30,000 or more, and the company keeps releasing more expensive modules for purchase. Buyer The game is expensive and addictive. Arnold Schwarzenegger ought to be ashamed for endorsing this money-making scheme."

A lot of money must now be spent just to keep up, making it impossible to play. You will never be able to keep up with all the new products they release on a weekly basis since the items you just bought for 99 cents will be obsolete in a few weeks. DO NOT fall victim to this money scam. Try a gambling website if you wish to spend money on a game. At least there is a very slim chance that you will get part of your money back. You have ZERO possibility of making back any of your hard-earned money with this game. Spending a lot of money only to discover that an attack or combat cost you the most of it. Do not download and play unless you have thousands of dollars because MZ is merely out to make money. Games are sluggish and extremely expensive. Customers are useless unless they can spend frequently enough to remain competitive. Join the GOW strike to force MZ to see that they must listen to players rather than just chasing."
anger,THIS GAME REEKS OF SHAMELESS GREED,"Mobile Strike, in contrast to Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft, is solely concerned with money. Although you can download it for free, you will need to invest a lot of money if you want to advance in the game. Even the game's fundamental and extreme tasks have been altered, shifting the emphasis from strategic thinking to financial acumen. You can make a sale for $5 in the first instance, then $20, then $50, then $100, and so on. The true shocker is that if you buy something at any level, that dollar amount sale is no longer available to you. For example, once you buy a five sale, you can never buy another five sale, even though you can buy a pittance of gold for each amount level. Mobile Strike would be worth recommending if it concentrated more on how to make the game engaging for its users rather than how to acquire their money. Suck suck suck"
anger,"Don't bother, it's a waste of time and money","Most awful game ever. You literally spend a lot of money tapping your screen thousands of times in an effort to establish a solid foundation. They then fail to give you the files and supplies you require, draining you further. THEN they release new material on a weekly basis to keep you splurging and pressing buttons. Oh, and disregard customer support. Worst ever, nothing is fixed, nothing is given, and you are just told to wait. Just wait, but don't stop your buying. I know folks who built their bases for almost 10,000 dollars and are still unable to compete. Now, even killing enemies is impossible. Simply hurt them. I am a level 40, 4MT power base, and I am unable to kill a level 9 rebel because I lack mobile ops. Every day, I send tickets, but to no avail. It is a total waste of time and resources. I wish I had never started. I tried setting the commander skill tree for a set of gear for two hours last night, but the game booted me just as I reached about 2500 of the roughly 3000 points set. I tried four times before giving up. Oh, and you want to attack? You will be expelled at least three times. It's a terrible way to waste life. I'm tired of having to touch on my iPhone countless times per day only to establish a foundation that is useless."

You can't compete with fools that spend over $100 just to seem powerful, thus it's boring.

anger,This game sucks you in as a free game,"This game lures you in by offering it for free. If you really want to play it, you must be prepared to spend money on packs in order to level up and acquire better equipment. But every few weeks, a better set of equipment replaces that one, rendering it outdated. Purchasing the packs is insufficient. It takes a lot of busywork to create, improve, obstruct, etc. You must establish a base with at least 50 trillion power before you can engage in full combat. This will cost between $50 and $100 every day. True, every day. In a few weeks, there will be more. Although the majority of people would not pay this much money, some can and some MS employees also play the game for free. They can kill you in one blow since they are so strong. One strike can erase all of your hard work; it takes days to rebuild. The majority of people won't enjoy this game."

Inadvertently, I simply dumped money into a money hole, and I now regret ever paying a penny to play this game. I'm now disputing my transactions with Itunes and potentially my credit card company to see if I have a case because customer service hasn't been much help. Even though all sales are supposedly final, I believe in the end I'll have to pay for it because I'm not getting the quality and consistency I paid for as a paying client. The ideal scenario was for me to play on a mobile device to pass the time, but I believe that the lack of upkeep has only shaken my faith to the point where I doubt continuing to play any game that demands advancement. There are many good games available that won't break the bank, but everyone to their own. All I can say is that I'm not receiving my money's worth, which is why the review is negative.

It won't be worthwhile to even get back onto the game if you try to play for free because you will just be assaulted repeatedly by large players that paid money to play. The durations for construction and research are absurdly long—I'm talking months and years here. I've seen screenshots of research timers with all the special equipment on that were two thousand days long. Customer service will simply advise you to purchase packs to lower it, so make another purchase. Bottom line: Save your time unless you want to play for as long as it takes to pay your mortgage."

There is actually no end goal because it is NOT a game and you have to constantly spend money to compete. Spend, spend, spend is all there is. Once you've exhausted your base, don't worry; something new and pricey will be released within a few hours. To avoid, in my opinion.

Be my guest if you have thousands to spend on a game that provides no return on your investment, but don't assume you can win by trying to play for pennies on the dollar. In my opinion, it requires at least one pack for each level your foundation advances. Although the game has difficulties, the payouts are much worse than the gold packets. The amount of money and gold you invest to accomplish a task is 100 times more than the rewards. It would be possible if the packs cost $5 each. At their current price, 100 a day won't help you reach the top."

Developers will play the game and secretly delete your resources and base before emailing you to ask you to purchase another pack so you can start over. Spoiler alert: It's still a coder taking your money whether they provide you a link to a discount web page or ask for an additional $100. Since this post, I've observed that piece shields disappear before the timer is out, and you be attacked in a matter of seconds.

Every few days to a few weeks, they release a new pack, and only the 99.99 packs are even worth purchasing because the rest won't even keep you in the game's competitive bracket. Another issue is the game's glitchiness, slowness, and severe problems caused by the intense load on it. I've had a number of issues with the game. I've already spent close to 700 on in-app purchases, and the programmers claim that the only way to remedy the problem is to give you a few benefits that don't even come close to making up for what their sluggish servers and app crashes cost you. Even worse, despite being aware of the problem, they kept quiet about the fact that some of the things in their premium packs didn't appear in your in-game inventory after you purchased them. When I contacted the customer care personnel about missing things, they even confirmed this in an email exchange with me. Fuck all, fuck fck all"

fear,One Star,"Everything in this game is exactly the same as it is in Game of War. All they did was alter the theme. So it's just a TRAP to earn money, exactly as GoW. It requires very little skill and tons of money, but the images are horrible (they're nothing like the ads). It's also really aggravating when you first begin a game and individuals with armies that are a thousand times stronger than yours repeatedly burn and murder your bases as a clever method to get you to PAY so you could defend yourself and attempt to advance. Everything is essentially geared toward selling you gold. Every time you launch the game or even view a notice, an advertisement to purchase gold pops up repeatedly. It is obscenely obnoxious. feels like a pop-up ad-filled porn website. Then, things get interesting when you choose to purchase a pack. Your initial purchase is $5, followed by a second one of $25, then a hundred and more. And they are identical. As a result, the same pack that cost you 5 earlier in the game will now cost you 150. Therefore, they are essentially boosting the price for repeat clients. Simply said, you don't start using strategy until you reach level 21 or higher. Up until that point, it simply comes down to who loses patience and who has the money to travel to HQ21. After that, you can engage in combat with your alliance and begin planning. If you spend less than $100, it takes you easily 45 to 60 days to get there, and even if you spend more, it takes around a month. Overall, if not for all the intrusive commercials, the pricey gold packs, and the lack of a better framework to aid smaller players, the game could have been fantastic. As with the false advertising they created, graphics should also be improved. In general, neither you nor your children should play this game. Do not waste your money unless you are willing to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars. Online account purchases are significantly more affordable than account creation from scratch."

I have spent $13,450.00 in total, which puts me far behind the competition. They now add new items every three to four days, and without them you are unable to compete. All of this is already unacceptable, but now they have started outright stealing money from players. I purchased a $100.00 pack, and five minutes later, another $100.00 was charged. They claim they don't have a record of the purchase and won't give me the pack I paid for or my money back. Thirty of the folks I know have experienced the same thing. So I made the decision to play exclusively with gift cards, but I soon discovered a new scam where they accept your money but fail to deliver the pack. Although they claim they are, the things are not in my account. I've supplied six screenshots demonstrating this, yet they continue to claim it's there despite my evidence. Things got worse last night when I started getting attacked and the game threw me out. I attempted repeatedly to log back in but kept getting a server busy error. To log back in, I had to remove first and then reinstall. When I did, I discovered that the game had changed my armor, making me weaker, and that more than half of my millions of troops were gone.

However, I will want money from you at some point in the game, so you're better off resigning right away."

sadness,Keeps crashing,"The download is the only element of this game that is free. You will be bullied by players who have spent tens of thousands of dollars and by constant, high-pressure sales ads. It entices you, but take caution. It starts out reasonably priced at 4.99, but you'll soon be making thousands and even tens of thousands. Once they have your money, they start to release more and more challenges and exclusive items that demand the 99.99 ""pack"" repeatedly. Spend time with your family or do something constructive. This will leave you anger and out of thousands of hard earned money. You cant ""beat"" it and are left with nothing in the end PLEASE DON'T INSTALL THIS GAME, YOU MUST TRUST ME"

sadness,vary slow load,"The makers are merely releasing that game with a new skin to draw in new players because it is extremely sluggish to load and kicks me out when I'm playing Game of War, which is in its death spiral. You can purchase this game if you like, but you should be aware that there is no real value in your account, so you might want to think about investing your money in something more meaningful."
fear,Don't waste your time or money,"I spent at least 500 playing this game for far over a year and a half. Other gamers have already spent enough cash to purchase a new vehicle or house. You guys constantly making it harder to make any kind of progress in this game. You folks made me detest it, so I had to delete it. It's unfair when individuals spend 90% of their time playing this game and have nothing to show for it because I felt like I worked really hard to get my base where it was and I couldn't afford to spend money like most people can. It's impossible to have fun because of you guys."
anger,EpicWar Killed MS,"Mobile Strike never has bugs, but my Kindle Fire does. It simply takes a brief pause. I have to tap it repeatedly to get it moving because it is likewise quite slow. I wish I could, but I can't suggest this game to anyone."
sadness,Bugs,"Play now for free in the App Store with ""Mobile Strike"" for nothing? I need a break. There is so much garbage being pushed down your throat and shoved in your mouth that it isn't even amusing. The worst thing is that the screen is completely blocked by these advertisements, which are running nonstop 24 hours a day. And Arnold Schwarzenegger, come on! real creative dudes Get away from this game. It lags a lot and is similar to all the other building games. NEVER squander your time."
fear,complete garbage,"The lag is horrible, speaking as someone who is well-versed in the game industry. I've played it in many places, each with a different wireless range, and the lag is consistent everywhere. This bothers me because I use a 4th generation Kindle Fire HD. I shouldn't have this much lag in any situation, especially when the tablet I use has a quad-core processor. At least the fact that the game is free makes me happy, and I recognize that the creators must generate some revenue. I won't hide my dislike for the game's preference for the pay-to-win faction, though. Regarding the promotion, I recognize that it takes a lot to get a game like this out there. However, I believe Arnold Schwarzenegger went a little overboard. I would suggest the developers attempt the Linux method. The focus shouldn't be on the financial aspect. The goal is to get people together to have a good time. If the game were actually fair, I can say with certainty that it would receive more favorable reviews sooner than the day I made this comment: 198 users gave it 5 stars. 1 star was given by 254 people."

sadness,Bad and very slow serve and you'd need to spend ...,"This game is horrible. A replication of a 1980 video game in 2000 graphics. Additionally, as there are no regulators in the game, if you are a week-old player with 1 million power, be prepared to lose against a two-year-old player with 200 million power. The antiquated chat system necessitates the download of additional chat room apps by each player. So, in conclusion, don't spend your time."
fear,Don't waste your time or money,"First off, the advertisement and the game are incredibly dissimilar. For example, silos cannot be used to launch ICBMs. You'll need to put at least $500, preferably more, into this game if you want to be genuinely competitive. The $99.00 ""packs"" can be obtained for less in a number of locations. Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off deals are occasionally available for the game, which helps keep prices low. The 19.99 and 49.99 packs they occasionally sell will let you get by, but progress will be agonizingly slow. The procedure could take a long time. Plan a lengthier session with at least one hour per day at a different time. There is a sense of a virtual community as you work inside the Alliance you join, so it's not just a one-on-one battle (membership has its benefits). Men and women both perform well at all playing levels. It can be a lot of fun if you have extra money."
fear,"Fun, but Bring Money","I don't like clicking buttons, waiting for them to beep at me to press them, having my device beep at me to press them, and then having to wait for the game to load after it crashes. No? In order to pay for instant button pressing, you then press the gold button. Yippee Oh, and read the chat remarks from the idiots when you're done clicking buttons."
disgust,Pushes your buttons,"This game is terrible. may not function quickly and well on older iOS and Android devices. On my iPhone 4S, the state map crashes every time I access it. The game's strategic depth is lacking despite how simple it is. You are essentially told what to upgrade. However, if you are not a part of one of the state's key coalitions, you will perish. Every time I reach a particular power level since I began playing, the ruling alliance has demolished my base and confiscated all of my resources. If you wanted to invest a lot of money, you could become competitive, but the strong coalitions would still amass a sizable army and defeat you. I spent a lot of money to finally get close to my alliance, but the first day they just kept pounding bases, and I was absolutely devastated. Your power will probably never increase if you can't play continuously."
anger,Very Limited Chance to Be Successful,"I've played Mobile Strike on both a Kindle and a Google device. It can be a fun way to kill time if the application is reliable, but the Kindle Fire version needs a lot of work. It is obvious that the game's creators put more effort on draining your wallet of your hard-earned money than they did in building a solid foundation. If you've never heard of MS, it has a design similar to Game of War. Before using resources to build your foundation, they must be built in the proper order. Construction requires a lot of time and resources. If you want to play this game for a while, it's helpful to read some of the internet guides. Your bases will soon be destroyed, your supplies will be exhausted, and those ruthless, kill-at-all-costs players will execute your commander. These players seem to have an unlimited supply of resources and control the majority of the game's areas. A player can easily amass tens of thousands of dollars with bonus boxes that include speedups, boosts, additional resources, power choices, and other potent commodities sold at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT."" Since you have to buy ""commendations"" to move on in the game, your commander will eventually become locked at a specific level. This is among the worst pay-to-play games I've seen recently. Arnold's support for a game that takes advantage of its players in this egregiously inept combat game, where the only way to win is to be the one who pays the most, astounds me but doesn't surprise me."
fear,Not Ready For Kindle AppStore,"Game of War has been my favorite game for more than a year. I downloaded Mobile Strike to try it out. It is a perfect duplicate of GoW, save for the scenario and timeline. Although it is advertised as being free to play, you will shortly discover that you need to shell out a lot of cash (as it is genuinely a pay-to-play game) in order to even begin to compete. Because the developer is a division of Machine Zone, the customer support will be terrible as well."
anger,Dont bother unless you are rich,"Instead of receiving an automated email answer from the marketing team for this game, which will steal your money and your phone and deceive you about game packages, there is no customer service phone number to contact. They may sell you packs that are generally 100 but are only 20 when you purchase them, or they may only give you the older packs rather than the new ones. Their relentlessly aired adverts, which highlight new things they're trying to convince you to buy, are absurd. Spend a few dollars every other day to play, and when all you want to do is go on to the next screen, it will try to trick you into purchasing a package. ap bought and paid for. and won't work on my Kindle Fire HD 10.

It's no longer real. It gets worse since despite my efforts, Amazon's automated system will not let me ask for a refund. Therefore, it seems that I was fooled by both the dishonest and now-defunct seller as well as Amazon, which is still offering a product without any help or feedback from the vendor. Shame on Amazon"

I made notes, highlighted, underlined, and added comments as I read a pdf file. When it started to crash on page 9 of the 10 page document, I was taken aback. Before this, the tablet would freeze whenever I tried to write something, and I would have to wait around 40 seconds for it to respond. The worst part is that if you want to access this document using Adobe Reader, only the highlights and comments are retained. I tried killing background processes, deleting and reinstalling applications, and clearing the tablet's memory, but none of those things worked.

fear,a purchase shouldn't need to have license renewed,"I haven't had a chance to utilize it in a meaningful way yet, but so far, I don't like it."
disgust,Worthless,"I always get a ""invalid file"" warning when trying to open a PDF file, and the program then crashes right away. Call me crazy, but I'm fairly certain that this program was created specifically for PDFs. I tried numerous PDF files, all of which produced the same outcomes. Every other Office/PDF app available opens these files without a problem, only this one. Even doing a double uninstall and reinstall didn't work. I tried calling customer service, but I never got a response. When the developer finally assists in resolving this issue, I will rate this program with five stars."
disgust,Worthless,"No document would open, and the software keeps crashing."
anger,Beware,"Program needs continuous internet access. The first time I tried to use it offline, it attempted to connect to a distant server but failed, crashing and requiring a hard reboot. It was uninstalled."
sadness,Three Stars,App won't launch.
sadness,Doesn't work,"I don't believe If it always operated offline without requiring me to update the license, it would receive a 5. I detest it. I am unable to access any of my downloads. Simply closing, it returns to the home screen. This app does not operate at all."
fear,Simple but not  User Friendly,"I got it because I believed it would be superior to the built-in PDF reader for my Kindle Fire. It isn't. And every time I attempt to perform a task that is more complex than reading a file, the program crashes and closes. I'm just relieved that Amazon offered to give me this piece of garbage for free."
anger,dont download,acquired it. No PDF will open. I've wasted my money.
sadness,Kindle HDX - Does Not Work,Not very attractive and unfriendly. The app frequently crashes
sadness,Two Stars,"Few PDFs can be opened using this. Nine times out of ten, it fails."
fear,New Perm's Wanted?? Why?,The app will not function at all. opens none of my PDF files. I want my money returned.
sadness,works wonderfully but,"I've tried a few various PDF readers and this one is, in my opinion, the best. The docs open smoothly and rapidly. The only issue arises when you choose to save them; technically aware individuals will know to click on the 3-dot link, but others may find themselves having to re-download a document that is already stored in the memory (just in the temporary files). My husband and I had to go through the procedure, which is why I only gave 4 stars."
sadness,There are better choices,Don't waste your time on that; it's not what I was expecting.
fear,excellent app but hungry for ram,"Once the PDFs are open, I can't seem to find out how to close them. There are no options for close, exit, quit, or load on the file menu. The fact that there are so many crashes, I suppose, is good. For Kindle HDX, it is currently completely unstable. Kindle Appstore sale gave me the app for free."
sadness,PDF max is not working ,"lacks sophisticated features. Few PDFs can be opened using this. Nine times out of ten, it fails."
sadness,Junk.,Uncertain about the additional permissions this app requires. Please share details regarding the updated permissions. Rating of neutral till I learn more

sadness,Doesn't  work at all,"excessive storage use, subpar speed, and a cluttered interface. Uninstalling."
sadness,Whatever,"One of the best PDF apps on the market is this one. However, the application slows down the smartphone and uses more than 200 MB of RAM. Make the computer less memory greedy, then I'll put it on my list of losers."
sadness,Can't reload purchased app,"I've only used the program a few times, but it seems to operate as described. However, it didn't function properly when it was used. Later, I'll post a revised review; I didn't even download. Few PDFs can be opened using this. Nine times out of ten, it fails."
sadness,Three Stars,"You can't beat MuPDF because it doesn't work on Toshiba Thrive, starts slowly, and some PDFs won't open."
sadness,Don't work,"This would be helpful to update, but some of my documents won't open. I took it out."
sadness,Not opening pdf,I am terrified of it because all the tools function so poorly and often don't even do anything.

sadness,Not working,Utilized device: Galaxy Note 3.
sadness,unable to install,I was unable to use the software entirely. I had trouble selecting and annotating the first page. I can only see page 2 every time I try to change the annotation. I was then unable to see page one. Scrolling was ineffective. Using a stylus is ineffective.
sadness,Can't install. Keeps failing install,I haven't yet assessed all the capabilities of the product.

sadness,App not working,"I was unable to download anything to my 10"" Galaxy Note 2 tablet. remained in error. Sorry"
sadness,Crashes,"It was installed on my Moto G first, and it worked. However, it doesn't work on my LG GPad tablet, where I would use it. Sadly, pdfmax has ceased operations. I receive that error. Furthermore, I don't even have to open a PDF. I receive this problem when browsing with either my explorer or pdf max."
sadness,"s3 tab, crash crash","As soon as I start the apps in the S3 tab, they crash and I can't even open a single file."

sadness,Does not work,"I bought the app, but it is broken."
sadness,Two Stars,need the latest version; perhaps this won't work for other people since the current version is 4.4.1 also
fear,Not A Happy Customer,"superior to other pdf apps Current, however, is 4.4.1. Need the newest version; attempted numerous times to install on the Note 3; will not work; app is useless. If you repair it, I might try again."
sadness,Problem in Galaxy note 2014 The app don't open...,I don't understand why app developers keep adding new permission requirements without bothering to explain them. One can only presume it's done intentionally. It's an automatic removal for me of an app that was once good.
fear,Why does it need to record audio?,"Await the explanation of the new permissions. I won't be updating till then, too. Your preference"
fear,Dud,It appears that the application is not being updated
sadness,Save Your Money,"The auto-open feature of this app is no longer functional due to the most recent update. The app displays the message ""Invalid File"" when attempting to open a pdf from an email, etc. When the pdf file is opened directly from the app, everything goes smoothly. The app is feature-rich, but until this problem is resolved, I can only give it a rating of 2 stars because it cannot be used as a complete PDF solution."
sadness,Three Stars,"Used to do all I asked but now refuses to open any pdf file, even ones that it used to open selected from the recent file list."
anger,sucks,"I've just purchased and downloaded this app, but it does not work on my Kindle Fire HD. I would return it for a refund if there was any way I can see of doing so."
anger,Won't open my important pdf file,Just fine but I never really found much use for it after I started using mendeley\spointless and useless. There are no advantages to having this over having a standard reader; the editing features are arbitrary and impossible to use.

We replied to your text asking why you had my number and letting you know who we were. He identified himself as David and stated he was browsing the app's contact list after just downloading it. We called him and explained the situation to him. Without a doubt, we were all three perplexed. So David will change my profile to be his and delete mine.

I will delete this app when I find a better texting app because it erases phone numbers, won't let you add their profile, and if you text too much, an error will appear, forcing you to delete their number just to text them. So please don't get this app unless you like crappy apps like this one; I didn't like it at all. In addition, you'll need to buy credits for it."

fear,Would give 5 stars but...,"I really want to know whether anyone else experiences the issue of certain people's texts disappearing after a short while. After a couple of weeks of working, I have a ton of folks whose SMS don't arrive. I really want this fixed since I hate that it has virtually stopped working. Aside from that, I adore this app. I enjoy the texting feature when it works, but the calling is bad and only used in emergencies. Please improve that. Many thanks. - User, text me."
fear,Disappointed,I don't like it.
disgust,text now,"I couldn't get it to operate, but it was incredibly helpful when my iPhone died. The only problem was that I had to be connected to WiFi in order to make a call, but because there are so many hot-spots now, I can live with that."

sadness,"The sales pitch does not explain that recipients without ""TextMe"" ...",excessive advertising Don't use; deleted. excessive advertising I removed it.
sadness,It is not free,"It isn't free. I was able to call and SMS people when I ran out of coins, but I deactivated it because I wouldn't pay for those services. I removed it even though I wanted it to be free since I refused to pay to phone or text anyone once I ran out of coins. My grand daughter ordered it, thus maybe I should get it for free."
anger,Terrible,"Mostly Because everything is free, I call this the bomb."
fear,No pics,disliked it since it was completely ineffective
fear,Waste of time and effort,I can't get in because it keeps returning to the home screen.
sadness,Two Stars,"It ought to operate more like a phone, I think. It can be challenging to sort through the messages; it would be preferable if they were displayed individually."
fear,Dont use,"When the speaker is on, no one on the other end can be heard."
fear,Bad design,"Although it is helpful, I wish it operated more like a phone. It can be challenging to sort through the messages; it would be preferable if they were displayed individually."

sadness,... had a hard time staying interested but it got better.,"Actually, I wouldn't give it even a half-star. The show frequently ends."
sadness,Credit based,"Disappointed with the product after discovering that a fire tablet can only send text messages, not receive them. Driving a car that only travels forward and has no reverse is an analogy. I removed the app."
sadness,One Star,This CANNOT be used for free. Worked perfectly for months on the premium plan before abruptly ceasing to ring whenever I received calls.
fear,Disappointed.,"I don't like it, but it's silly because you don't have to wait that long to reach me if you choose a number to use. To preserve your number, you must pay."
fear,Not free,It was incredibly difficult to use or understand. did not enjoy it at all. didn't know when it was turned on or off either. Just bad was completely ineffective. Worked perfectly for months on the premium plan before abruptly ceasing to ring when I got calls.

fear,you can do better,"When my daughter used this app to text me after school, she received a message and a photo from a stranger, which is really unsettling for a parent."
sadness,One Star,"At its worst, Textme attempts to rob you and is clumsy at best. Worked perfectly for months on the premium plan before abruptly ceasing to ring whenever I received calls. The software appears to be designed to deceive you into purchasing credits even when you are paying for the premium service, and there is no customer care. I regret not getting rid of it earlier."
sadness,Not what I thought,"Rings the tablet only if the Kindle 7 is awake. Moreover, there are notifications issues."
fear,scary for my child,"This app is horrible. My 9-year-old daughter was thrilled to finally have a ""phone number"" so she could text with family from her tablet, but very soon after setting it up, it stopped taking messages from them. Simply put, this was a frustrating and perplexing mess. Get rid of this."
sadness,There is nothing free about Textme,If I only had access to Wi-Fi everywhere.
sadness,Fix it please,Worked perfectly for months on the premium plan before abruptly ceasing to ring when I got calls.
anger,This is a terrible app. My 9 year old daughter was so ...,I adore TextMe since it offers limitless messaging but also a lot of calls.
sadness,It's awesome,"It cannot be beaten for nothing. To utilize it, you only need to be close to a WIFI location. The only negative for me is that I didn't use it frequently enough. When you stop using the dedicated number for a few weeks, your contacts must learn the new number you get the next time you use the software."

disgust,Try it. You'll donÕt  like it.,"simply amazing Try it out, please. I assumed I would be able to use my present phone for texting rather than getting a new one because every time I tried to use it, it would crash and then inform me an unknown error had happened."
anger,sucks,The entire EMOJI situation is not cool at all because you can't use the EMOJIs. (
sadness,Awful,"Every time I attempt to view movies for credits, it doesn't work and instead automatically turns to offers; I don't enjoy this. However, not all calls are free. I'm required to give them credit."
fear,I didn't use it long,"Seriously, do not waste your money with this software."
sadness,Disappointing,"I only noticed it as a typical app where I could video chat, though. I own a kindle HD, and it doesn't work. When I select a free account, texting me stops. Sign in; stop texting me. Can someone explain what transpired?"
fear,One Star,"It says free, but I had to purchase minutes. I only used it for texting, not calling, however after a limited amount of texting, it needed to be purchased."

fear,Not for me,It just does not work.
sadness,Cant do nothing it wont even let you complete process fully. You cant call. It doesnt work,"I erased it because it didn't work for me. When compared to an iPad, messaging on a Kindle must offer a better alternative."
sadness,There must be a better solution to texting on a Kindle verses an iPad,"I constantly having to restart every time I back out, and I lose ALL of my contacts. Get this instead if you want to text someone."
sadness,Disappointed...,"Would not function on my Kindle, which offers free messaging but expensive call rates."
disgust,Two Stars,"They claimed that this program was free, however I have alternative VOIP and texting apps that operate just as well. You can't text or email this one."
sadness,Does not text to anyone,"Despite this app's high level of functionality, it is not particularly stunning."
sadness,Three Stars,I was never able to call it.
fear,Not user-friendly,"I'm not too happy with the app now that I've downloaded it for my Kindle Fire. Without using their emails (which will eventually saturate them with spam), which I will not do, I am unable to build contacts. Although it is not particularly user friendly, my son enjoys texting my relatives and friends. Since I don't have many options on the Kindle, I'm going to keep it for the time being. TextMe will be removed whenever I discover a replacement."
fear,Just found out that I need to be on line ÉI am afraid bro,I recently discovered that I must be online to receive anything I ordered. not had time to use the internet.
anger,Wish I could do one star,"This app is a hoax, I'm 90 percent certain. You receive random texts about it. It's abhorrent. The app was instantly deleted. GET THIS APP NOT, I don't like it. I don't know anyone else who uses this program, and I don't want to SMS an unknown number. Though I hope it does, it is now worthless."
anger,Never used it,"When attempting to open virtually any PDF, the software occasionally displays an incorrect file. I reinstalled the program in the hopes that it would be fixed because I used to adore it, however it is broken."
anger,Worst app I've ever bought,"frequently crashes. even after restarts, cannot open. No possibility of refund. I'll update to mention one issue I came into.

Other than that, I continue to be pleased with how well this software performs. crashes Opens.pdf files far more quickly and functionally than the Adobe software. If you work with.pdf files at all, you absolutely need to have this program. Performance is amazing when I use it on a Hisense Sero-7-Pro. EDIT: I'd like to mention one issue I came into. The pdf files of sheet music do not appear to open properly in this application. Similar problems also occurred with other apps (Adobe app works).

sadness,Doesn't Work on Samsung,Not all PDF files seem to be compatible with this program. Adobe Reader has never given me any issues. I would give PDF Max a higher rating if it consistently performed well with all PDF files.

sadness,Google drive authentication failure,Displays PDFs well but adding free text is just a nightmare. You can wait seconds for a letter to appear and the keyboard gets confused when you try use all caps.
sadness,Useless,"This app is useless since it will not connect to any Cloud service to import documents. Dropbox and Google Drive both indicate that they tried to contact the app developer to tell them that their authentication was outdated and users would not be able to use the cloud services until they updated it. Who knows how long ago that was. In the technology world, this is business suicide. I made the mistake of paying for this app and it doesn't even work for what I need it for. So don't waste your money. Just go download Adobe Reader from the Amazon Appstore and it does what you need it to do (plus its FREE) (plus its FREE)."

disgust,I'm quite dissatisfied with Amazon.,"I once adored this app. It has been glitchy and obnoxious ever since they made the update that contains constant advertisements. Every third message I send takes a long time to send and occasionally never stops saying that. I began copying and pasting to try sending the identical message once more. Usually, the third or fourth try is when it sends. Even if I deleted the others while they were still sending, they all transmit as soon as one does. So either no text or multiple texts with the same message are sent to the person I'm texting. Incomprehensible for professional conversation. If these flaws weren't present, I would have paid $9 for the software, but I don't think I can afford to do so now. Fix it, please. Before you started making money with it, this was the best app available. I really don't want to have to get a new phone number and a separate app."

I placed the number on the website and all over signs across the city. I was unable to receive calls and it slowed down my business completely. I was unable to contact anyone at the company. I emailed over ten times and continued to receive a generic reply. If your going to use this company for anything serious I suggest you stay far away. Cost me so much money and time.."

sadness,horrifying,It is bothersome because it continuously sends hourly notifications.
anger,I got it,"If I could choose 0 stars, I would. This is a terrible thing. You will receive 100 friend invitations after downloading it in about five minutes. When choosing an age range, I chose 14 and the names that were added to me were really crude."
anger,NEVER OBTAIN IT,"Very terrible Every time I try to create an account, it will first ask for a list of characters, and then when I press the next button, it will ask me to complete a series of stupid tests to ensure that I am not a robot.

sadness,"terrible, awful, etc.",This app is a time waster. Kindle could perform a lot better. Please refrain from downloading it.
anger,"Get Real is the worst app ever, yet Snapchat actually gave us something","I assumed this was an imitation from Amazon because my son enjoys SnapChat. The only thing this app offers are lists of usernames to add to SnapChat, and it randomly adds your username to the list. A boo can add you frequently and chat with you. My username is STILL there even though I logged off and uninstalled the annoying app, and people are still able to access it, add me, and send me chats. I'm so fed up with it that I want to uninstall my actual SnapChat. Please make it so that your username is removed from the list when it is deactivated."
fear,Avoid downloading this.,This app was completely useless. I only gave it one star because I removed it from the list but I was unable to give it zero stars. I kept my older version on my phone because I detest this one.

I'm unable to download even a basic app for my academic work. If it's that difficult to create real apps or are you simply too lazy to actually make things so simple, I'm getting the grade instead of you. I'm not the only one who is sick and tired of it, and this is coming from an 11-year-old who finds it sad that it has to be that way. I'm sure every person who downloaded it wants to throw their Amazon tablet, phone, or whatever out the window, and if you don't read these, get ready for a lot of freaking phone calls."

fear,1 Star,A search engine.
fear,Very difficult game unless you're capable or willing to...,This app is garbage. You must have a SnapChat account to use it. Don't waste your time getting it because it will simply be simpler to obtain the regular one if you thought you would only be able to communicate with people.
anger,Its constant tutorials are bothersome.,"I have to give this at least one star in order to leave a review. It functions to search for and add new friends. Not the actual app, as I had assumed.

anger,Helps are WAY too expensive and need to be improved.,"I had to download Mobogenie to get my snap, but it still doesn't work because I need Google Play services.

It's time for the app store offered to Kindle users to keep up with the times and offer apps like SnapChat, Instagram, and other popular ones rather than outdated obscure ones that receive fewer than five downloads annually.

Winning either the regular play or the bonus rounds is getting harder and harder. Which makes it less enjoyable now. I once used an Android device for gaming. I was somewhere between level 90 and level 100. I switched to playing on my Kindle Fire tablet when my tablet blew up. It lacks the benefits that watching ads and earning jewels gave the Android. And level one was where I had to start over. It has taken me more than a year to reach level 44.

I've read numerous reviews from other players, so I'm aware that my experience isn't exceptional but rather quite typical. The players who cheat the most and spend the most money control each state. Spending more money than the other players or hacking the game to obtain items that would otherwise cost money are the only ways to win. The ultimate goal of the game is for each state to cooperate in order to defeat other states in point competitions. By completely destroying their base, the petty power bullies, on the other hand, refuse to give any smaller players the chance to fully participate in the challenges. I regret downloading it. I'm glad I avoided spending money on it. Oh, right Like the Mafia, the major players try to bully and threaten smaller players into paying for their protection.

fear,Horibble,"This ""game"" is essentially robbery. DO NOT purchase this game unless you have an endless supply of cash. In essence, it is riddled with bugs, frequently crashes, and you can never advance in the game to actually compete unless you have $100 to spare every few days. Unquestionably NOT FREE The game's developers insist that you pay to play, but they never fix any problems, and they are certainly unhelpful when you contact them. I feel guilty. I would like my hard-earned money back after having spent it."
fear,Is texting not a verb?,"You can only advance in this fame to a certain point before having to spend actual money. They advertise gear for the strongest, but you can only get it by purchasing ""packs,"" which is equivalent to paying with gold, but the money has no value. You only buy the pack for the gear so you can compete with other bases without getting smashed, because you KNOW they've purchase the latest gear. So you drop 100 thinking it'll be worth it. Then 2 days later they release new ""all powerful"" gear, rendering your gear outdated, and you can't buy the newest gear without spending another 100 They pitch the gear as being worth a specific price, then they depreciate it days later without giving you a refund because they want to sell you the REAL strong gear.... It's a racket. They are thieves and liars."

fear,Jumping advertisements are a major annoyance.,"If you can afford spending 100 per day, than this is the game for you. Glitches, terrible performance, horrible customer service, and a lot I can't recall right now. Used to be a nice game, but the greed of the game developers ruined it. Pretending to be a free to play game is not cool. Don't download it."
fear,"As said, it is not free.","Mobile Strike really has no rules but one, to charge 99 for a ""pay to play"" method that's somewhat addicting and VERY pricey after a relatively short amount of time. Incentives you buy in resource packs are quickly made useless with end-less 99 pack requirements. The game is a complete rip-off. No end to it. It's a trolls game. Don't fall into the trap"
anger,"Love it or hate it, Kindle","TO BE COMPETETIVE, YOU BETTER BE READY TO BE SUCKED IN TO A MONEY PIT."
anger,This bullsh*t app doesn't support video chat; it didn't work,Crashes regularly. Definitely need 100's of dollars to compete. Don't even get started
fear,"My son's Kindle was stolen, so I activated a...","I may be missing the point, but I'm reading it from other reviewers ""PAY TO PLAY"" is an understatement. Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get over level 21 to receive any amazing units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases well. Well, guess what, even with that high beginning package I paid for 4.99 and then 19.99, to reach to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to improve the buildings in the base. And BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the modest price of 99.99. I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might spend 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent. MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (actual money), and they got my last coin for sure. I only hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was prepared to blindly hand out 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so. Just saying...\sMobile Strike is a lousy excuse for a game. Epic, has plainly constructed a platform that has enabled a typical swindle to satiate avarice. The game is extreamly frustrating. I played this game when it initially debuted and enjoyed it for a number of months. When I stopped the first time I had just passed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22. There is a constant desire to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective. Most packs cost 99. After a year I returned back and there now is level 60's. epic provided a catch up pack for 4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was 19.00 to bring me to a level 90. Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astounding. Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT) (MTTT). Epic continuously is updating the game, ever increasing the necessity to pay additional packs to attain the next level. Once a level is extended they are enhancing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lesser power level does not stand a chance battling an opponent that is 10 times stronger. So, the 4.99 catch up offer suddenly became into 99 packs to keep up. The current edition of the game demands two power steps a week to be competitive. I would definitely recommend to stay away from this so called game."
fear,Simply not my style,"The game is not only unwinnable under realistic conditions, it is a high tech scam, I've spent around 50 on the thing and what I can see is basically players who are paid to devastate the real paying customers, there is no upside, it's literally just a money making scam that is well polished, player support is non-existent considering the money going into the game, basically avoid avoid avoid It's essentially a pointless game that is designed to rid you of your money, it's a shame because if it was aimed toward gameplay it might have been fantastic, at this moment playing the game is superfluous."
anger,Sandijeans,Boring. Slow crash. Don't spend your time. Removed it immediately after.
anger,to the worse,You can get booted out of the game for both in if somebody who has greater power says so and theres nothing you can do\sI would not know I downloaded it and was unable to play it on my fire
fear,"Worked till a few days ago, then it stopped working.",This game would be great if there were some boundaries to who could attack who. People with 60mil+ power farm people with 500k and less is ridiculous... Not worth spending real money on this game if I have to spend it on rebuilding.
fear,This app is awful.,"This game was pretty fun at first; formed an alliance and met some really great people. Unfortunately within approximately two months it became such an apparent money trap that many stopped playing because we could not keep up with the cost to stay competitive. The packs start off cheap (5, then 20), but eventually rise to 100, even 200. At a particular level, there are items that are needed for advancement in the game, but can ONLY be gotten by purchasing a pack. This is simply my perspective of the game, and I would highly encourage reading other reviews from others before downloading."
anger,Not at all helpful,"It's free to download and that's about it. There comes a moment in the game where you must start buying goods to play it. Unlikely some games where you can play the game but speed it up with payments, there are many things you just cannot do in this game without making money. The purchases are pricey too. The packs they constantly advertise to persuade you to buy usually cost 99.99 apiece. One pack will not do. There is also a steady onslaught of adverts for packs. The game is fairly glitchy at times too. Finally, they keep making the number of resources needed to do things and the real time needed to complete them that at some point things cost trillions or quadrillions of resources and would take you trillions of days to accomplish is you did not buy speed ups from them. The math alone is getting very overwhelming. I play because I made some pals early on and don't want to abandon them. I wish I had not gotten started though. this game us stinks bro"
fear,READ,"The game keeps pushing upgrades and boosts on you every minute you play. Not only that, once you pay for a kit, they raise the price and keep doing it without providing it at the same price ever again. And if you don't spend any money then you can't actually compete and are just there to be defeated and lose all your progress. Not worth your money or your time."
anger,I don't like it.,"This game is a Huge money sinkhole and is meant to trap you into spending large amounts repeatedly. I played for a couple of weeks, spent a lot of money, built up a large fort and military force only to undergo a ""major onslaught"" that wiped me out demanding another significant amount of actual money. The packages of resources are substantially priced—lowest and smallest is 4.99 (doesnt last long) up to 99.00. Although it is fun to play (but not easy to grasp), it will cost you more than any other in-app purchasing games that I have played. Can't recommend"
fear,I'm unable to continue.,"Same company as game of war, they modified it to scam you. Spend 5 for a pack. Now you can only buy 20 packets. Then you can only buy 100 packs Oh, those packs are setup to offer low quality material so plan to buy much more..."
anger,HATE It is incompatible with the Kindle HD Fire.,For a game that has been on the market as long as this it is utterly pitiful that it has severe stability concerns. It crashes constantly on multiple Android devices. Completely unacceptable. Between the awful stability and the fact that you actually have to pay hundreds-thousands of dollars to not be a doormat the game is a huge waste. Don't bother.
anger,"When it wants to be useless, it works.",Be ready to invest much or don't bother playing
fear,Not a fan,"Nothing to add - my Grandson downloaded it without me knowing, it's gone now."
fear,AVOID DOWNLOADING,Download is free but to compete you have to buy packs regularly to even have a chance of staying up. Spent money on the game in the beginning and stayed in the top 25 in state for a few months but then they continued pushing update after update out and decided it was time to resign completely as it just isnt feasible to spend that much money on a game. Met a lot of interesting individuals and check in from time to time but most I know quit spending because it would take a boatload of real money to even stay competitive
anger,It is a ruse.,It is a game of war swindle and tricks you into buying goods if I could I would give this game one sixth of a star since you can chat
anger,Bull,"EVERY review I have read is spot on This game is a big ploy aimed to bleed you dry of your hard earned money. Make no mistake. They care not about you, your game experience or anything of the type. Full game problems, awful lag that makes competing impossible and brutally annoying.

The customer service or lack thereof is absolute horse manure CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IS RIGHTTo whomevers' Lawgroup decides to really take this to the courtroom. BRAVO, and thank you I hope you take them the the cleaners like they have been taking us for the previous 3 years or so.

Too much new insignias gear research... cant play anymore too much upgrades to fast. New upgrades virtually everyday. So everything you buy is obsolete in 24hrs or less. Dont bother playing waste of time and money. Not fun at all. MS is greedy and made the game awful. Only guys that make 6 figures up can afford to play this game.
fear,"I'm not a fan, omg",This game is incredibly expensive and the authors alter the game so frequently that the goods that you just spent money on become obsolete. Be prepared to pay at least 500 to compete properly. I hope I never spend a dollar on this game because honestly it's worthless and I can't even sell my account to re-coop close what I've paid.
fear,Does not work Does not work,"This is an addicting game however, the game it's self is nothing like the stated graphics that are pertrade."
fear,BEWARE,Game keeps quitting every couple minutes. Perhaps too taxing for my device.
disgust,Not friendly to users,My son did not enjoy this. There was a lot of waiting and not a lot of game play. It was a free game thus there were a lot of adverts wanting to sell you 5 add-ons.
anger,I swear I'm not a moron.,"this game is a fraud. the continual push to spend money. if u do spend money the game crashes and glitches so much u end up loosing much of what u paid. then to replace u have to make another buy likewise it could be free to download but if u want to up grade u have to purchase a gold pack if u want all the building u have to make a purchase. that would be a great game but I guess that's the point u want to play but in order to play u have to pay\sVery Expensive to play. I'm talking hundreds, some pay in the Thousands. It's a pay big to win type of game."
fear,Too Dumber to Comprehend ANYTHING on This Tablet Disappointed,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME . IT COST TOOO MUCH . YOU WILL REGRET EVER DOWNLOADING THIS ""FREE"" GAME . THE ONLY THING FREE ABOUT IT IS DOWMNLOADING IT. I HAVE LOST RESPECT FOR ARNOLD. HE SPONSERS THIS GAME KNOWING PEOPLE WILL LOSE SO MUCH MONEY."
anger,"I haven't used it a lot, but","I downloaded to try it, but certainly not my thing..."
fear,similar to a virus,"If you have money to waste and don't mind support ignoring you, then this game is great for you. I was stupid enough to spend money and got no where. Others leveled up rapidly and then it makes the game nearly unusable for others. I don't suggest."
anger,Done Dislike it,This game sucks you should buy if you dislike playing games
anger,Errrrrrr,"This game is not like anything in the commercials or demos that you see while playing other smartphone games. The game itself is quite glitchy and often shuts down on you unexpectedly. Pros:+ Addicting and fun+ Pretty in depth method with a longer learning curve Areas for improvement:- Glitchy, app randomly stops down- Too many adverts to spend money and buy packs- Sometimes the notifications do not work properly I would give this more stars if it wasn't so glitchy and they didn't harass you with adverts to spend money. Be warned: the game is incredibly addicting and in order to get anywhere, be competitive, or experience the full aspects of the game you have to pay real money...\scan't figure out how to accomplish anything in this game"
disgust,No Information,"Game dpesnt function good. Camt change commander gear without freezing, help desk tickets never get anything done. They don't and cant seem to fix bugs"

fear,I do not advise ad bombardment.,"This game is spiking, too much stress on the fone for a pesky game. Packs are pricey and don't anticipate anything from the devs regardless how much you invested on this game."
anger,Annoying\saverage,"Buyer warning when you buy a game pack you dont get everything that is in the pack, then when you contact tech support you will get the run around and finally your emails will go unanswered. Now the game is so shaky the required talents needed to add to your game will boot you out of the game totally. They have raised the bases so fast that the game is shaky. Each State chat has the same comments about tech support which is pretty depressing. Game masters: perhaps you need to stable your game and correct your packs instead of extending your bases so we can play the game efficiently."
disgust,They steal while maintaining a straight face.,It was O.K. but did not last very long. The green section fell wore out quite rapidly.
fear,Ineffective to me,"Giving it one star simply because I can't give it a zero. Complete piece of junk that's not worth the price of ""free."""
fear,Does not operate with the Kindle Fire HD 10,"This game is incredibly addictive My hubby has changed for the worst owing to this game. He spends several hours on this game and money our family does not have.. He seldom sleeps and has now turned bitter, harsh and irritable with our grandson and myself. This game sucks you in like a narcotic and then starts pulling away your life.. I will be leaving My home soon bc my hubby is a different man and use to be my best friend.. I have spent many evenings alone owing to this game. We are currently living in two different parts of the house because of this game.. This game has took from my family and nearly feel my husband needs an intervention, I know how that sounds for the ones out there laughing but If I can help just one person, then I am fine with that.. My spouse seldom showers and does not move from his game seat.. This game has created so many conflicts cuz it's like being cheated on This game has become his life and all he cares about.. arnold schwarzenegger has already looted enough from his own Ppl as the gov of Cali and now my spouse and many others are filling his wallets.. I should get a suit for emotional damage. fuck them all"
fear,What?,"Cost too much to keep up. Literally thousands. Sure it's free to download, but they need to pay Arnold somehow."
anger,I attempted to open an account for my kid.,"Man, you're scarcely playing for a minute before it starts banging you up for money."
fear,I detest the recent update.,I've been playing mobile strike for 4 months and it's not wise to play unless you want to spend a lot of money.
fear,Needs Kindle assistance,and then sometimes its not working. Find another game.
fear,fraudulent app,Consumes your time and continually asks you to spend money on upgrades. You can't be successful in this game unless you consistently dump money into the game. There for it wasn't entertaining after a time. I don't suggest this to anyone.
sadness,"SWINDLE, that is.","Excellent game, really enjoyable and detailed with no short of things to do. The only concern I have is this game requires a lot of to properly grow and to receive all benefits from it. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the cost to expand and the cost keeps going up the more you pay. Packages start at 9.99 and every time you buy one go up until they are 99.99. I realize some games are more but this still isn't fair to the ordinary gamer."
fear,unfriendly to users,Got the app then after lot of free items I discovered that it is dull and fucking
fear,It's awful. not what I expected it to be,I donr enjoy this games because if you Gets fascinating at higher levels but takes long to reach there without IN-APP payments. Large social element to the game. Do not plan on controlling the roost when you first start.
anger,Stupid,Spent 3 hour could not manage to play the game. Ads the reconnect then Ads again. There is NO GAME to play. JUST ADS.
disgust,"Okay, but... horrible",donÕt Love it. Addicted to it. Save your self and run. While you can construct a basic trap account for a couple hundred bucks a rally filler will run 200 - 400 a month and an attack base is thrice that.
fear,No recent incoming calls were received Dumb app,This game lacks a none pay to play mechanism. The packs that are supplied are deceiving and do not tell exactly what level you will reach. I donÕt like to communicate with friends and meet new individuals on the map. This is a pay to win game.
disgust,"Quite a bit of trouble, and nobody saw the...",It would load and sign me out nearly right away.
disgust,Use More Than One Star,It was a little too complicated for me aND not my sort of game
fear,Does it function without WiFi?,"Waste of time. Tons of endless jobs to progressively acumulate assets, ammo, labor, etc. Not my type of game. Uninstalled it after 30 minutes."
fear,Trash,"Overly complicated and takes at least a day for huge battles to happen. Until then, you build walls. buildings and other structures and take on local quests for points. They appear more focused on taking your real-life money for gold that you will need for large upgrades (One upgrade is 99.00) to win battles. Not worth it unless you have a lot of money lying around. Hey, someone had to pay Schwarzenegger's salary for his TV promo."
fear,I did not purchase this app.,"This is not the coin pack I wanted to purchase. I wanted the 10,000 coin pack, cuz you get a higher discount and more savings. But it would only enable me to purchase 2 of the smallest packs of coins, and I only saved .40. That was not even worth the time I vested in attempting to earn the savings in the first place. The only reason I tried making the purchase for these smaller packs is because I was told by one of your technical support person to do it first, and then try the bigger pack. After making the purchases for the lesser packs comma it cut me off. And I was not able to make another purchase at all, let alone the larger pack that I was trying to ultimately buy. So in the long run I wasted an allot of my time and money purchasing the smaller packs of coins in the first place. I was ultimately rewarded for it. Thank you for that. But I would have really loved for this issue to have been fixed for any future purchases I would like to make for coin packs."
fear,Not worthwhile.,"Addicted to this game for a year now. I donÕt love to detest it Be prepared to invest 40,000 if you want to play with the large alliances. If you don't want to pay to play you should stick with Farmville."
fear,What the hell was that?,"Way to pricey to play. If you want to be competitive then plan to shell out hundreds per month. Greedy company... I invested into the thousands over a period of a few months and I couldn't go close to being competitive. So... I quit and transferred my account to a friend. The game is pretty uninteresting unless you have hours to waste. Lot's of useless click/tap only to improve XP etc. When I say lots... I mean hundreds of repetitive taps over and over... I fell asleep numerous times doing this dull task. So, I don't suggest this game to anyone and if I were Arnold... I would get my face off the game myself. Game has potential but money has poisoned the firm and I don't see it lasting very long without a huge change in how they do business."
disgust,No option to add contacts,"This game was obtained for my grandson, therefore this review is essentially made from his feedback. He is seven. Overall, he puts this game in the middle ranks of his gaming interest. It is definitely a bit too advanced for him as it is truly a strategy game on civilization development and military action. It is perhaps more suitable to kids in the 8-12 age group. He tells me it is amusing, and after seeing him play it for a few of hours, he was happily (and quietly) entertained. Be aware that it is mainly a game of nation building, but it has a lot of violence inherent in the results of that nation building."
fear,team texts,there has been about 300 in charges put to my bank account from my spouse playing this game its bulls**t and and hate it and strongly discourage this game.
sadness,"Stay away, please","The UI is slow, crowded and unclear. The map is un-navigable. The ""chat"" feature is related to the gold shop, but there is just a primitive ability to speak with other players. The ""blog"" is a succession of blurbs regarding the latest deal bundle. Although posing as a ""war game"" there is nothing of strategy or tactics - which required C3 (communication, command & control) (communication, command & control). Also, the game is not playable without paying a LOT of money. 99.99 purchases are required to unlock critical structures, technology and military skills. My suggestion - don't bother."
anger,Worthless,My 8 year old son erased it when He noticed it included guns and knew I wouldn't agree. That is no reflection on the game.
anger,It's fine.,useless money grabbing trash aimed at draining your bank balance buying pointless upgrades
fear,Annoying,"You need to spend money for anything. It's basically a glorified chat room. I played it for over a year. It was entertaining in the beginning, but they spoiled it with updates."
anger,"Possibly helpful, but","Another one of the army stuff, that I can't deal with. Also not Works really nicely for the younger crowd"
fear,Contacts,"It's a highly addictive game, however would never recommend for anyone playing on any sort of kindle. The game is incredibly slow, it freezes way too much, and there's constantly troubles while buying gold. My advise, either sell your kindle, or find a better game."
sadness,Deleted the apps,"Its too fucking awful, only the cost for anything is a touch high and it logs me off a few times. - Makeitwork"
anger,"Spying, I guess?","I assumed it was a shooting game, haven't shoot anything. Upgrade this, upgrade that, would you donÕt like to buy something....they call me general,I'd rather be a grunt."
anger,Avoid wasting time.,I dont enjoyed this game but things have changed. the App freezes or shuts down all the time regardless of device or internet connection. This game is falsely marketed as free to play. You have no chance of playing if you can't pay at least 200 every few days due to the continual introduction of new things that can fully overpower all existing stuff. They have run thousands of people away with the ridiculous cost.
disgust,"Poor Options, but it still functions and is free",The speed ups cost too much. And it takes too long to get things accomplished without them. I donÕt love the game otherwise.
disgust,Embarrassing doesn't work on tablets,You can't progress ahead in the game unless you buy a new pack once or twice a week. Money hole. Not working
disgust,"What a complete waste of time,","Crap- intended not to be a game, but to reach into your pocket. Made me feel as thinking they had all the movements planned and there was nothing much for me to do."
sadness,"Not simple to use To utilize it, you must have credits...","Game was amusing for a brief time but is nothing but a money maker for Epic War. In order to survive and maintain in the game, you have to pay hundreds of dollars and by the time you think you are set, Epic War comes up with something else to make you obsolete and you have to spend even more money. I have deleted the app and will never play another game like this again. Beware"
sadness,Useless,Money hungry developers. Fuck them all . New updates at least once every week. Worthless unless you're a billionaire - but if so why would you waste your time on this game.
fear,"For me, not","There are two major activities in this game: talk with others, build up a base for battle. The chat rooms are loaded with improper conversations for younger players. It's a dreadful environment for women too, as practically everything that shouldn't be stated is. The worst thing is the fee to play. It's billed as a ""free"" game. It isn't, unless you want to play Farmville within a military game. It will cost you thousands to play if you wish to be competitive In game packs are continually available from 99 to 349 apiece. ""Bouncy boxes"" are frequently shown to entice you to spend so you can receive the ""extra"" stuff in the crate too. This is in-app purchase at its absolute immoral worst and should be prohibited."

anger,Sucks \sbad,"extremely stupid Instead of hiring Arnold, they need to have invested more money on the game. The game always crashed just as I was ready to enter battle, it is extremely slow, and there is no one to battle, so I'm sad that I'll never get the time back that I wasted on it. AVOID BUYING THIS GAME"
sadness,"Not bad, but download from another source.","Not bad, but I suggest side loading it through Google Play rather than Amazon. Your game will freeze because the program keeps disconnecting and trying to reconnect to the Amazon store. This frequently reboots the program when used on a Fire tablet, frequently at the worst possible time. **Edit** Purchase upgrade packs for this anywhere except Amazon. The processing time is excessive. Buying something on Google Play happens almost instantly."

Support is useless; all they do is continuously emailing you pointless messages."

You must repeatedly complete the same stages, expending all of your energy while occasionally never making any progress toward collecting anything.

I am therefore trapped. cannot place a call. You can't use my number. And what's worse is that it hasn't been the first time for me. The previous time, I had to change my number completely. Sounds easy enough, however the fact that you can't save any contacts makes it a major inconvenience. As a result, each time you receive a new number, you must enter the numbers of everyone you speak with, start a new chat thread, and let them know about the change so they can identify you. I currently have a 4.99 upgrade subscription, so that's just much too much ""Keep my number, dial unrestricted numbers, and skip advertisements Once more, I'm helpless; I can't upgrade, and I can't place calls. incredibly irritated Please address the problem that is causing this."

You cannot separate the email you entered when signing up for a resignation. On another Fire, it operated without a hitch and provided my daughter with a local number, but not me. You must provide a local number or at the very least the same area code if they want people to use the phone component. Because it intends to charge 5 credit each text sent from a USA phone to a USA number, the rating has been reduced to 1 star. How accurate are these free text messages to phone numbers? If you have to purchase credits in order to utilize them, the service is not free. This was sent to a USA number using a USA phone and a USA number provided by textme. Okay, FREE...

disgust,Aggrivated\sI haven't been able to run this app at all ...,"Today, it keeps crashing. Unable to send or open. Complete trash. It used to operate flawlessly."
sadness,One Star is awful,Both my Amazon Fire tablet and my iPhone were unable to use it.
sadness,1 Star,"It was just placed up yesterday. I still have to learn more, but so far I like it."
sadness,1 Star,The only drawback is that you must be thirteen to do it. This app is awful.
sadness,Very fearing app,"I like it, but because I can't access the app, I only rated it three stars. If you could help me with this, I'd give you five stars. I entered my password and email, but when I try to access the app, it just sends me back to the login screen."
fear,Did not like it,"It says open, but it has now stopped downloading. I was going to redownload it, but I'm unable to do so now, which makes me unhappy & perplexed."
sadness,"Download once, appears in every acct u have",quite challenging to use
fear,1 Star,"Even worse, the video option is inoperable. I won't and don't do it for anyone."
fear,Can't call out at all\sfuck,It must be made free because it's somewhat silly.
sadness,1 Star,"arduous to use, Receive unwelcome calls when it is functioning, which is rarely."
disgust,I donÕt like bro,"I have a great wifi connection. Not this app. To get you by until you can pay your phone bill, however, I can say that it will be sufficient."
anger,Kids should be able yo use\snot Easy to use,too many advertisements Never worked at all Please address all screen layout concerns.
sadness,Complex\sfun with texting?,"After sending one text, the software wouldn't let me log in again."
fear,Can't use\sdumb,The app also states that the texts are free. I'm not sure how having to pay for them or earn them makes them free.
sadness,1 Star,Is total garbage: ( AVOID DOWNLOADING RUDE APP
fear,Two Stars\sjunk\sH,"This product's lack of value, in my opinion, is astonishing. The program contains the most garbage I've ever seen built into it. Even a computer expert would admit that the ""ease of usage"" is nonexistent. I would feel ashamed if I had created something that awkward. And if it at least allowed you to send basic text messages, all of that may nearly be forgiveable. My own doesn't. The icon that should allow you to send a text message is not even present in the basic version that I downloaded. At least the price seems to be about right."
fear,Not free to use,"not majority of the time, worked. However, there are much too many advertisements."
sadness,Stupid and horrible app,I am not receiving all of my SMS even though the app is free to use for messaging and talking.
sadness,1 Star,"The nicest thing I can say is that the letters are beautiful and large because, as a wi-fi app, you might as well be using something with a stronger signal, such as a landline or a cell phone."
fear,Not free\sTexts,"I need credits to make calls; the whole point of these apps was to make free calls. Why must I fill out a survey or purchase credits. Even worse, the video option is inoperable. I won't and don't do it for anyone. AVOID USING APPS LIKE THIS. You would be better off simply purchasing a phone and making yearly or monthly payments."
fear,aaaaaahh,"I didn't enjoy it, so not for me."
fear,Autocorrect is horrible,shifted my opinion.
anger,kinda doesn't work,I haven't yet been able to resolve this
sadness,One Star,Please repair the phone not ringing and the inability to transmit pictures to others.
disgust,They don't tell you that whoever you want to text must belong to TextMe.,inserted without my knowledge: grandchildren
anger,Do not download,It runs smoothly but cannot send pictures.
sadness,Very bad deal,"Even worse, the video option is inoperable."
fear,1 Star,"This content didn't interest me at all, and you keep bringing up advertisements in conversation"
fear,Not worthwhile.,"I started getting a disproportionate volume of unsolicited messages soon after I activated this app. I quit using this app in just over a month because even though they don't cost me anything, they are a tremendous hassle to go through."
sadness,Horrible on Fire Tablet,He has a too-wide leg. False advertising for a texting service
fear,Don't waste your time,"For individuals who own non-cellular gadgets like tablets, this is really helpful. You're good to go if you have wifi. It is quite simple to use and copies your contact list, saving you from having to enter all those numbers over."
sadness,Nope.,unable to send photos and daily receiving spam Must I say more?
fear,THE APP DOES NOT WORK,"I abhor this app. I used to have it, but after a while it threw me out and wouldn't let me sign back in."
anger,Not worthwhile.,Not trustworthy. Both times and sometimes don't work. not a keypad
anger,I hate it,not even understand how to use?
anger,Don't waste your time.,"Time not worth it. For 5 days, I just watched 4 videos to get cash. After three separate offers and a ton of filling out of questionnaires, I went to sign up for the offer to get extra coin. NOT A COIN."
anger,Eh\sMy teenager told me about this app that I was ...,"I haven't figured this out yet I don't know Love this software, but it's hard to use and has a lot of bugs."
sadness,I do not recommend. No like \sapp just shuts down,False advertising for a texting service
anger,Not Safe for minors,Children may open an account without parental consent.
sadness,No thanks.,"No videos for two weeks, no coins for you."
fear,Not compatible with Samsung S5.,"It requires unlimited calling and is unable to SMS individuals who do not have the app. I dislike you, bro."
fear,DID NOT WORK,"Lots of advertisements, but not cool. I don't enjoy this app overall."
fear,This app needs improvements,"Text messaging is really sluggish, but it won't be manageable overall."
anger,Didnt like it,"As stated in the advertisement, it is not free."
sadness,Not friendly to users,"I wasn't on for five days, and my number was removed."
sadness,I would give zero stars if I could,It costs money to obtain credits. I cannot use the internet and lack a phone.
fear,1 Star,Texting is not possible to those without the app. That's exactly why I downloaded the app.
sadness,Had issues with the app not sending my texts.,It was terrible and ineffective.
sadness,Full of ads. No reason to download this,Not user-friendly and unable to SMS those without the app. That's exactly why I downloaded the app.
anger,Why Bother ???,"This app was just updated. It keeps telling me my email or password are wrong even though I am certain they are correct. I was signed into it when I horseshoe I am not. Even after I got someone to give me the number, it won't let me in. I try to contact help, but the page won't load, and I don't want to create a new account because that would mean losing all of my messages. Someone needs to act immediately."
sadness,1 Star,"On my Kindle Fire HD, I haven't been able to run this app at all. This app has stopped every time I launched it, it would say. So maybe if I have it operating on my Kindle Fire HD tablet, I can reassess this rating."
anger,what the fuck\sOne Star\sdisappointing and waste of my time,couldn't make it work.
sadness,It was security arrangement on top of security arrangement.,"It claims to be free, but credits are required."
fear,Why I don't like it,Not at all user friendly.
anger,Don't want.,Works poorly on the FireHD
anger,Not what I expected so deleted it,utilizes wifi. Keep your phone number fully separate from the account for your device. I'm scared of it.
sadness,Hey guys.,"I put it on my daughter's Kindle. It's possible that I misinterpreted, but I believed it to be a free software that I could use for my kids. After a few months, my kids were unable to use it, and I received an SMS inquiring who I was. It turns out that the TextMe app's phone that was assigned to me was really given to someone else for their new phone."
sadness,Horrible App.,It manifests everywhere. no power to set boundaries.
sadness,failed to work,"When the keyboard quit functioning, I immediately erased it."
sadness,Poor service,Worst SMS and call application ever
sadness,Three Stars,"It is not what it seems to be; it is awful. It stinks because it won't let me text farther than 20 feet; I made three accounts and it still won't let me on. To call, you need credits. Acquire credits by finishing offers."
sadness,Really not worth it unless you adore advertisements,"I was really furious when my boss sent me the same text message repeatedly and I would receive random calls. I got a very critical text that I was supposed to read, but I could only do so if I paid for the membership. Take a chance when downloading this program because of this. I dislike text me's free app since it has bugs and does nothing, thus I don't want to get it."
fear,Horibble,"This does not support video chat, and the supposed help robot is completely ineffective ""Transform your Kindle into a phone"
sadness,Error message,"""WRONG. This bullsh*t app has zero compatibility with the newest Kindle HD 8 (6th Generation). profoundly disappointed One star."
sadness,Just not my cup of tea,"It works for my Kindle Fire, but it frequently crashes and won't accept incoming calls. When I call from my landline I get ""the number you have contacted is not in service"". Allows outgoing calls though. Useless."
anger,Sandijeans,"HATE IT It just loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and loads, and, well, you get the picture. Do yourself a favor. Save yourself the gigs."
sadness,to the worse,In it scarcely worked and it was not my favorite app
sadness,fails to work,My brother got a call from someone at a PRISON this software lets ANYONE to text your kids dONE DOWNLOAD
anger,Crashed immediately,Do Not by this app for a free number. It is no use. You will embark on a trip with no technology. It will cancel your number and the only way to get it back is by paying for a subscription. Don't waste your time you are going to get scammed.
sadness,Worked Well Until A Couple Days Ago\sWon't work,I got an email this afternoon at 4:30 saying I had to utilize my number or else I would lose it. Not even 4 hours later I go to use it and its gone Ridiculous... Doesn't even give you a chance to accomplish anything.
sadness,Kindle problems,"It's really not cool; you can't text, call, or FaceTime your buddies. However, I must say that it has a lot of adverts and is rather difficult to grasp. But aside from that, I don't like it."
anger,The Fire tablet is useless for texting. Avoid downloading,Does another device need TextMe to make calls or send SMS messages? TextMe is an app that provides a free number for SMS communications.
anger,No Information,"I could only use TextMe after downloading it if I paid 4.99 per week or 8.99 per month. What is unlocked? I am unable to enter anyone's name, let alone their home or cell numbers or addresses. I wonder whether my receptive processing impairment has anything to do with how useless it is for me. Almost everything I try and fail at, I miss out on. I'm over it. I discover they are billing me 59 each month two days afterwards. If I knew how, I'd file a lawsuit. They get away with it in this way. What BS"
sadness,Ineffective to me,"No Notification, which worries me because this program should have sent us a notification. No Information I think we need a notification from this app because I'm terrified about it."
fear,What?,"It's incredible that you can text and call. The speaker doesn't function, you can't face time unless you both have the app, and calls arrive later than they do, but it still contains everything I need."
anger,Stupid,"Yes, it does work. I think that's it. 1. The app opens only partially of the time since it is so slow. 2. You can't do anything till the adverts have loaded. 3. Notifications are at best subpar, occasionally sending six or seven for a single text. 4. After the most recent upgrade, I am unable to name my talks. Totally useless app."
sadness,"Okay, but...","I had assumed that I would be able to sync my phone and tablet using the same number, but instead it gave you a new one and required you to create an account? how depressing"
anger,Terrible,"I attempted to create a profile for my daughter. When we tried to log in again, it simply redirected us to the start-up page and wouldn't let us. have attempted reinstalling and password reset. Since she doesn't have a phone, she was happy to have a texting app on her Kindle Fire, but none of the ones we try to download appear to work. Really disheartening for her and very stressful for me."
anger,Stupid app,"This program is used by con artists. I put a car up for sale on Craigslist, and since then, I've been receiving texts from various numbers that say, ""You have reached your friend on text me,"" and when I call them back. Additionally, Text me must add security to its program otherwise every legitimate user faces fraud risk."
disgust,"Quite a bit of trouble, and nobody saw the...","The software asks me to provide 5 credits for each and every SMS I attempt to send, despite repeatedly stating in their descriptions that you may TEXT COST-FREE [""Free Texting (actual SMS messages) to any Phone number in the United States, Canada, and 40 countries.""]. All of this was sent to various different US numbers I tried to text from the US-based number they gave me (213-375-xxxx). There are other other user-interface issues, so I won't waste time mentioning them all. I do not serve as a volunteer beta tester. In a minute, the app will be removed from my Kindle Fire."
fear,Use More Than One Star,"It wasn't clear to me, and I didn't have faith in it."
confusion,Does it function without WiFi?,"My first straightforward issue is adding contacts, and the Kindle Fire is not mentioned in the help options. Because it loads so slowly and I've heard that you can only make calls occasionally per month, I am getting nothing for the money I've already paid. Don't install this app; it's terrible."
confusion,Trash,Really the worst app ever.
confusion,I did not purchase this app.,"My first straightforward issue is adding contacts, and the Kindle Fire is not mentioned in the help options. I'm receiving nothing for my previous payments."
confusion,What in the world?,"The issue began when my account was unable to receive calls. Big error, I created a phone number for my business using the app. I posted the phone number all over the city on signage and on the website. My business drastically slowed down since I couldn't answer calls. I was unable to get in touch with anyone at the business. I sent over ten emails, but I kept getting the same canned response. I advise you to avoid using this organization if you intend to do anything significant with it. I spent a lot of time and money on this."
confusion,No option to add contacts,This software is so idiotic that it prevented me from texting people because I couldn't remember stuff.
confusion,I HATE IT SO MUCH.,"I intended to use my own contact number, but it was a little too much trouble, and no one recognized the one they gave you."
confusion,ridiculous group texts,"Simply said, it is foolish. Now use text. My phone number was wiped from the app, and when I accessed it again, I saw that it had been shared with someone else."
confusion,Worthless,"My phone number was wiped from the app, and when I accessed it again, I saw that it had been shared with someone else."
confusion,"Possibly helpful, but",I don't understand why Amazon indicated that I paid for this (free) app. It was not anything I asked be included in my Amazon resources.
confusion,Deleted the apps,"I'm merely doing this so that I can receive texts and I wanted to download this app, but it would not let me. I really wanted it, but every time I tried to, it would say error. I also couldn't search for this app. The app deleted my phone number, and when I opened it again, I found that my phone number had been given to someone else. Please fix it so that I can use the Internet. I'm not sure what's wrong. xC"
confusion,"Spying, I guess?","My phone number was removed from the app, and when I accessed it again, I saw that someone else had received it. One star and I despise it"
confusion,Embarrassing doesn't work on tablets,I don't want to lie about my age as it says it's for people 13 and up.
confusion,"Not simple to use To utilize it, you must have credits...",The main issue I have with it is how poorly it manages group texting.
confusion,Useless,Please correct that for users of Kindles.
confusion,Please don't text ME.,"a little difficult to hear Text also does not function correctly. It won't be useful when I travel, I believe. This Studioid software is not to my taste."
confusion,Awful,a surplus of ads. Rather irksome
confusion,There are several reasons why I don't like it.,"The app doesn't recognize their Bluetooth headset as being connected, which is the sole issue."
confusion,Abhor it,"I downloaded it so I could use my tablet to text. It did work nicely after downloading and texting, I discovered. However, it gives you a phone number (I'm not sure how it does this), but it's not yours, and if you don't text for a while, you lose it. In the end, I removed it."
confusion,Doesn't work,Program use is more challenging and fucking a surplus of ads. Rather irksome
confusion,Save save energy,"it for more than a month. Over the course of a few hours, I exchanged some explicit texts with my girlfriend, and at the pinnacle of the exchange, I began repeatedly requesting for her permission to use the camera. Don't ask me this question again, even if I strike. It has been ongoing for more than two hours."
confusion,It's awful.,"Absolute trash... It did work nicely after downloading and texting, I discovered. However, it gives you a phone number (I'm not sure how it accomplishes this), but it's not yours."
confusion,AVOID DOWNLOADING,"I don't own any form of smart phone, but I do own a kindle fire tablet. As long as I am at home close to my wi-fi and using this on my iPad, it appears to be working for me. It seems to have relatively few features, such as the ability to identify the senders of my texts by name. It's difficult for me to remember everyone's cell phone numbers. Nevertheless, I shouldn't be upset because the software is free."
confusion,terrible and awful,"bro, it's not working. The app doesn't recognize their Bluetooth headset as being connected, which is the sole issue. Just fix it"
confusion,Very Poor,"Can't get it to work and it's a junk app. a surplus of ads. It was quite unpleasant, but I got it so I could communicate to my schoolmate. then when I exited the app, I was in the middle of a challenging game, and it proceeded to text me for no apparent reason while claiming that ""your camera and flash light are in use by another app."" I don't even have a camera or flashlight on this."
confusion,Spend your time poorly.,"It forced me to get a new phone number, which was quite inconvenient."
confusion,"You guys need to quit creating bogus apps, though.",Not simple to use
confusion,"DON'T DOWNLOAD PERVERTS, it's terrible.","To utilize it, you must have credits - I'm disappointed that the software is not free and is a useless piece of garbage."

confusion,None of the stars for this app.,"Give us the genuine Snapchat, please, Amazon."
confusion,SO BAD,"I was excited when I saw this since I really wanted Snapchat, but it's terrible. I wish Snapchat worked on Amazon tablets because I detest it and want I could change my username."
confusion,This Snaps item is terrible and I don't like it.,"This program allows anyone to follow your whereabouts, which is highly unsettling. Anyone over the age of 18 who lacks common sense should beware."
confusion,"Very horrible rubbish, just terrible trash.","Don't download this software since it's bad and it doesn't work. I wish it did since it would be a lot of fun, but the app won't be worth your time to download. because it is ineffective. Gratitude - Amazon User"
confusion,Awful\ssnapchat,I repeat NOT Avoid wasting time using this software. Completely pointless. SnapChat is not it. Why aren't we able to have The real deal?
confusion,It stinks that this isn't very well-liked.,"Very terrible Every time I try to create an account, it will first ask for a list of characters, and then when I push the next button, it will ask me to complete a series of dumb tests to ensure that I am not a robot. As a result, I am unable to even create an account. Please, Amazon, send us genuine Snapchat."
confusion,not what I anticipated,"I detest how difficult it is to sign up. I tried to establish my account, but it's all BS, don't download this app. I wish we had Snapchat on our Amazon tablets."
confusion,FRUSTRATING/AGGRAVATING/ANNOYING,"I don't like to be nasty or mean, but Snapchat is a poor app and a waste of time. Stop producing bogus apps, you guys. People want the actual app."

confusion,had no effect at all.,Perverts are numerous. What motivates Amazon Please send us the real Snapchat. This is garbage.
confusion,I retained my prior version since I detest this one.,"VERY BAD APP, you can't modify anything, and it asks you to confirm that you are not a robot before allowing you to view another page. Additionally, I can't think of even one instance of how disrespectful the names were. I reiterate: It's a VERY BAD APP, which is why your tablets cost $50, so GIVE US REAL SNAPCHAT, AMAZON."
confusion,1 Star,I failed to make it function. Spend your time wisely.
confusion,I felt let down.,Replace this app with the genuine Snapchat; I'm sick of it.
confusion,"I'm not sure what this is, but it's annoying and ridiculous.",I first insist on getting the real SnapChat and refuse to open it.
confusion,Why is One Star One Star?,"Bring the authentic Snapchat to my tablet; I want to chat with my buddies there. Without it, I'll sell this useless piece of garbage and spend more money on an Apple tablet that runs quickly and has useful apps."
confusion,One star,"This software keeps sending me strange additions from people, and I have no idea how to delete my ""account"" from it."
confusion,phony Snapchat,I abhor this app because it is the worst. It doesn't perform anything similar to Snap Chat; all it does is provide a list of users and ask you to authenticate that you're not a robot.
confusion,absolutely not like Snap Chat,"You just ever compliment other people, which is really monotonous. The worst app I've ever used is this one. GIVE IS THE REAL SNAPCHAT. AMAZON"
confusion,This isn't the genuine SnapChat and isn't even close. Amazon must develop those apps.,"Now, I get a lot of requests for snaps from individuals. I was unaware that it was that unpleasant."

confusion,"terribly awful, how it","Installing the bogus SnapChat version and downloading Google Play are the better options than doing anything else. Don't waste your time on this, please."
confusion,NEVER OBTAIN IT,"so foolish Despite the fact that I detest this app since it is pointless and foolish, I continue to receive snaps. After this was done to my account by someone else, I can't seem to stop it."
confusion,You cannot alter it in any way.,By no means can this be compared to Snapchat. I really want Snapchat.
confusion,This program is terrible and nobody should download it.,This program is a fraud; it is completely inoperative. This was a bad choice.

confusion,"Smh\sHORRIBLE Total garbage, NOT THE SAME",There are horrible perverts everywhere.
confusion,"This is awful, don't even think about it, just no.","My son likes SnapChat, so I assumed this was an Amazon knockoff. Only lists of usernames for people to add on Snapchat are contained in it, and it adds your username to the list so that RANDOM creeps can message you constantly. People can still use the obnoxious app, invite me, and send me chats even if I have signed off and deleted it because my username is STILL there. My genuine SnapChat would like to be uninstalled because I'm so sick of it. Please make it such that when your username is disabled, it is taken off the list."
confusion,HORRIBLY TERRIBLE APP,I'm not sure whether my kids are right when they say I just don't know how to utilize it.
confusion,PURCHASE THE REAL SNAPCHAT,"This app served no purpose at all. Since I took it off the list, I could only give it one star, but I couldn't give it zero. I still have my old phone since I hate this one."

confusion,"I wish a ""zero star"" rating was accessible.","I hate it; instead, download the genuine Amazon app; this one is completely ridiculous and no better than Snap Chat. What use is it to add an app if the app itself isn't compatible with the Amazon Fire phone?"
confusion,Snapchat\sFUN,"This ridiculous application is not the proper SnapChat app. Because I believe the real one is superior, I would give this app a zero."
confusion,Add me on Snaps.,Snapchat is not at all deceptive. Amazon must provide apps for those of us who own Fire products so that we can share them with loved ones and friends.
confusion,Sucks,I had a lot of trouble with this software and could never get it to work.
confusion,Just ignore it when it asks if you are a robot; how absurd is it,I'm not even able to register. unfit for use. Waste. It's not what I expected

You guys have been playing games with me, and I'm sick of it. Sincerely, you will eventually meddle with the wrong person and, hopefully, be held accountable for your scams. I can't wait until I get a phone because I'm almost finished with Amazon. Even the most basic program for my academic work cannot be downloaded. I'm going to get the grade in place of you if making genuine apps is that difficult or if you're just too lazy to truly make things so simple. This is coming from an 11-year-old who finds it sad that it needs to be that way and I know I'm not the only one who is sick and tired of it. If you don't read these, get ready for a ton of crazy phone calls. I'm sure everyone who downloaded it wants to throw their Amazon tablet, phone, or whatever out the window."

Gameplay that is monotonous, slow, and repetitive. If you aren't ready to play this game till you're retired, run, don't walk, away from it. a time waster. Did I mention that it was boring? You have received a warning."
confusion,Dreadfully Boring,It was so complicated that I quickly got tired of trying to figure it out and removed it because I couldn't afford to buy time to win a game.
confusion,became less appealing,"Due to the touch screen, play the game carefully to avoid any mistakes. can sabotage your strategy."
confusion,touchscreen errors,The only drawback of the game is that some of the items needed to finish collections drop at a slow rate.
confusion,Several grievances,"It would be a lot of fun if I didn't have trouble clicking on things. It wasn't my computer; the issue was with the game; every time I tried to click something, it would freeze before unfreezing. I had to uninstall it at some point."
confusion,Disappointed,Too difficult for young children. My 8-year-old grandson quit playing it because he was so frustrated.
confusion,Not suitable for children,"After more than two years, I reinstalled, and the original level was reinstated. It goes without saying that you folks greatly irritated me because I invested money and still failed every level. If I'm not compensated according to my level, I won't ever play your games again."
confusion,"After playing for two years, I lost all levels.","On my brand-new Kindle, I am unable to access the game's current state."
confusion,"Since it seemed to be just another game with different graphics, I deleted it.",I choose not to play it. I deleted it because it appeared to be just another game with fresh visuals.
confusion,"There are numerous things you can do, but the game is slow.","It takes a lot of work to prepare for the game, which is tedious."
confusion,Failure for fear of it,I couldn't get it to work on my iPad. I had to get rid of it
confusion,Bummer,Fun and sufficiently challenging to keep interest high. It is annoying when rewards aren't actually under the tile. afraid of it bro
confusion,Need assistance Energy is too slow,"If you like playing games where you don't win, this is for you. I stopped playing."
confusion,"When you shop, you need money to play. If you don't purchase ""energy,"" the limited game play is not free. Sadly, confusing","Although the game is enjoyable, the energy recovery time is too long. It can be monotonous to keep playing the same games to get the essential items."
confusion,Frustrating,"On my Kindle Fire, I try to update a game, but it says that it is only available for Android. What is happening?"
confusion,Time wastage,"I hate this game, and I want to get rid of it off my iPhone. The game seemed harmless at first, but once I started buying and lost all sense of what I was doing, the program changed, and I realized it was more like a casino game where I was winning real money. I got up and left. Even the soundtrack in this game sounds wicked. I simply abhor it."
confusion,My money is constantly being demanded. Hahaha.,"decent game, however there is a very overt attempt to get you to spend real money. restricted game play unless you pay for ""energy,"" ongoing discounts and promotions, Not a good"
confusion,"enjoyable, but overly repetitive","It's entertaining despite being perplexing. Half the time, I'm not even sure I know what I'm doing. I keep getting encouraged to finish stages that I've already finished and given three stars."
confusion,"I ordered another game, but I received this one on my Kindle instead.","Match 3 is a challenging and enjoyable game. It takes a VERY LONG TIME for credits to build up so that play may resume. Additionally, getting the things needed to get through the stages takes an abnormally high amount of tries. It is obvious that the objective is to get players to spend more and more ""real"" money. I seem to have resources and ""play"" money worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that are utterly worthless. extremely grating Spend your time wisely."
confusion,"The graphics are nice, but the tedious controls are fun but very expensive once downloaded.",The game is ruined by the sheer amount of nonsense that is going on. waste of time.
confusion,What happens when instructions are delayed?,"It was frequently played. It's a little annoying because the game is slower, tougher to enjoy, and probably impossible to actually win since I won't be spending any money on it. eventually became exhausted and put it away."
confusion,didn't enjoy,"It's a fantastic game, but there are much too many jobs that call for doing way too many different things. If they cut these by one-third, it would be more difficult. There are presently 20 tasks active at once, thus there is no incentive for you to complete one."
confusion,I dislike it.,The sequence was wrong.
confusion,1 Star,fails to function The app is difficult to use.
confusion,One-Star Advisory,"Sadly, I don't like it. For new energy and level advancement, it is too ""expensive"" and challenging. Despite the fantastic graphics, the tedious navigational method... Not to my taste."
confusion,Never again will you be forced to spend money during the game to make it enjoyable.,"It's enjoyable, but every level consumes a lot more energy than other games. quickly makes me lose interest."
confusion,Expensive,"Although thoughtfully planned and carried out, the problem surfaces as you try to make a substantial progress. It cannot be done without spending a significant amount of money. I'm going to remove what might have been one of the best games I could have found when I get there. It's a shame."
confusion,The worst,"In other words, it won't let you sit around doing nothing; you have to make the move it models for you. It truly irritates me. I deleted it after 10 minutes."

confusion,Ease of use and picture quality,Ease of use and picture quality. A little confusing
confusion,Good idea for an app but confusing and difficult to use,"Good idea for an app but confusing and difficult to use. The main purpose of downloading this app was so that we could stream content from our devices to our fire TV. After learning that our laptops weren’t compatible, we used our iPhone. This showed to be compatible, however we spent a long time trying get it set up. First, the user interface was difficult to understand and the instructions were pretty vague and confusing. Second, only certain devices are compatible and able to use so it helps to research and see what is compatible. And lastly, once we were able to connect and stream the iPhone to the fire TV, it would disconnect the connection about every few minutes and I am not sure why. Needless to say we gave up and uninstalled the app. I do, however, think that the idea of the app is very useful and productive."

disappointment,Does not work as a means of mirroring an iOS device to a FireStick,"Does not work as a means of mirroring an iOS device to a FireStick. March 3, 2020I was looking for an app that would allow me to display photos/home videos etc. from my iPhone & iPad to a non-smartTV via my Amazon FireStick.  This app supposedly does that using the Apple AirPlay protocol built in to the newest Apple mobile devices.  I downloaded the AirScreen app onto the FireStick from the Amazon website and installed it on the FireStick according to the instructions.  According to the pre-loaded tutorial video bundled with the app, I should then have been able to go to any iOS mobile device with AirPlay enabled and from the ControlCenter, scan for other Airplay compatible device connected to the same WiFi network (which the FireStick was) and select that device and begin mirroring.  Unfortunately the app was unable to detect either my iPhone or my iPad although both had AirPlay enabled and both were connected to the same WiFi network.I then called Amazon Tech Support and spent about an hour on the line with them while they logged in to remotely view my FireStick screen and operate it remotely.  The were unable to solve the issue so the called Apple Support, making it a 3-Way conference call.  The Apple support rep remotely logged on to my iPad and operated it remotely.  Again, no one was able to make the iPad connect with the FireStick.  Since I had already tried and had the same problem with an AirPLay enabled iPhone also, it seemed unlikely to me and to the Apple rep that both iOS devices were malfunctioning but rather that it was either the FireStick and/or the app itself that was the problem.  The Apple rep came to the same conclusion, so she departed from the conference call.The Amazon rep remained on the line and we did some further checks to determine if there were any other problems with the FireStick itself, which there were not.  Every other non-AirScreen related function of the FireStick appeared to be working normally so we all concluded that there must be a problem with the app itself.I had downloaded the free/demo version of the app, which claims to function fully without upgrading to the paid version, but with advertising pop-ups.  I was not going to pay to upgrade until i saw the app work as advertised, which had it done so, I would then have paid to upgrade to the ad-free version.  Accordingly I do not know if the upgraded version would have worked properly or not.In short, this app does not do what it claims to do and therefore should be considered useless for the purpose of mirroring an iOS device to a FireTV device."
disappointment,Bad app,Bad app. Didn’t work
disappointment,Didn't work,Didn't work. Unhappy with the app. Deleted it
disappointment,Useless to me.,"Useless to me.. Thought it was a method to view other movies, it is not nor does it show what can be done with it. A waste of time and money."
disappointment,Didn't connect or show up.,"Didn't connect or show up.. So I downloaded this app in hopes that I could stream directly from my 2019 Macbook Air. Everything seemed fine and the app seemed clean, but when it came time to actually connect, my device did not recognize my firestick as an airplay source. It never popped up and I am unable to use it. Disappointing."
disappointment,Monthly subscription fee,Monthly subscription fee. The product worked as expected but I didn't like the idea of a monthly subscription fee. A small one time fee would have been adequate but it was not worth a monthly fee.
disappointment,Not very good connection,"Not very good connection. Horrible connection to TV, would not recommend it.  Always gets stuck and keeps telling you to get the pay version."

disappointment,Not happy with airscreen,"Not happy with airscreen. I thought I would be able to cast like a chrome cast from my iPhone.

disappointment,gr8 recorder,gr8 recorder. It works well. I need subscribers tho. =(
disappointment,not recommended,"not recommended. This app is not recommended for videos longer than 1 minute... In my, safe, and honest oppinion, this app is horrible. Here are some of my reasons:*It doesn't let you edit your videos,*When you pause your videos, the controls button disapears after 5 seconds of your video being paused,*When you're recording you on-screen video, if it's longer than one minute, automatically pauses and ends your videos,*If you want screen recording with your face on it, you need the pro version, which costs money,*Sometimes it will save and show your video, but it'll erase all the footage and make it from a 15 minute video, into a 0 second video,Those are my reasons. Yet, just because I mention my opinion and a lot of people agree, doesn't mean you shouldn't download the app, or you shouldn't like the app. In all honesty, this is my own opinion, and you shouldn't depend on just one bad comment."
disappointment,Not good at all,Not good at all. The sound quality was terrible. It slowed down my Kindle. It just wasn't as good as I'd hope it would be.
disappointment,Not Very Useful...,"Not Very Useful.... I've downloaded this app to record a basic walkthrough of an app I made for one of my classes, and I was quite disappointed (okay, a lot more than disappointed) with the fact that this recorder is unable to properly create an mp4 of a video that is more than 20 seconds long."
disappointment,It's garbage,"It's garbage. I try to record A game and I record and save, I can't watch it at all, or it did not record at all"
disappointment,M. H.,"M. H.. I don't like it honestly. It's simple but I don't like the adds or in app purchases, it only lets me record for a limited amount of time, I think this is because recording apps are not very good on kindle fires, it doesn't really record very well and has very bad quality. I don't recommend this app to kindle fires. The only way to find a good recording app is to buy one probably 😑I'm giving it two stars because it could be worse."
disappointment,SUCKS!!!,"SUCKS!!!. IT SAYS &#34;NO ROOT&#34; SO I CLICKED ON THE NO ROOT INSTRUCTIONS AND IT SAID &#34;YOU NEED COMPUTER, ROOT, AND USB DRIVER&#34; THAT'S MEANS ROOT!!! THINK TWICE BEFORE SAYING NO ROOT BECAUSE I WOULD RATE 0 STARS IF IT WAS POSSIBLE. I'M DISAPPOINTED."
disappointment,Worse then it used to be,"Worse then it used to be. One time like a few months ago I got this app, it would work all the time and let me record my screen. One day I installed it again, it didn't even load the home screen. I use this for animating for like pokemon: love, battle, sad, friendship, etc stories. I love recording my animations on Flipaclip. Please fix this, I will rate this a 5 when you fix this on my Amzon Kindle Fire. I hope for this to work in the future."

Don't use this app unless you are prepared to scratch your head and wonder who does this!I'm a tech guy, have literally 1000's of apps, 100's I use all the time, constantly tweaking, streaming, VPN's, and on, but this app...is literally one that looks simple, is so in terms of coding, but immediately it advises you to go to settings and set up wifi, what for when you are connected via LAN.Then...one navigates over to settings and that is where it sits, and sits and sits.My insight is this, the premise of this app is just like the other ""live tv"" apk's however in execution...it falls flat.The base is fine, the developer really needs to step up on the delivery.Until then beta test, then test some more.This APK is a fail."

The app tells me that my doc was successfully printed but the printer says it is &#34;printing&#34; and that goes on forever. No doc is ever printed, not from my files or Gmail or anywhere else.

disappointment,Great but bad,"Great but bad. It let me do everything! But, it didn't connect with anybody!!"
disappointment,Bad port of a good service.,"Bad port of a good service.. The worst aspect of this app is that it continually fails to push messages from people. Often I will message someone only to suddenly have several messages sent to me hours before suddenly load. To the other people, it just appears I am ignoring them. Signing on to the desktop app at the same time will make the messages show up and be received immediately, but then what is the point of using the app if I have to use the desktop?The interface was already bad and they continue to make it worse with each update. Now contacts are separated into a long alphabetical directory rather than simply allowing you to see who is online at a glance. The desktop interface is fine, and I'm not sure why they feel the need to try and deviate from it.You cannot choose any status but online or invisible. Worse, you can't see if anyone else has their status set as away or busy. You simply see them as online, when in reality they may not want to be disturbed.The desktop program is fine. The mobile app however is handicapped in several ways. If you need a way to use Skype from your phone or tablet, this is unfortunately your best option. If you are just looking for a video/instant messaging app that doesn't need to be Skype, then choose something else."
disappointment,Ridiculously awful,"Ridiculously awful. I recently updated to this skype from the older version and regret it immensely. This ""updated"" skype is hands down the worst app I've ever had the misfortune of using. If you try to load a webpage on the silk browser, skype will crash. If you adjust the volume, skype will crash. If you plug in your kindle to charge, skype will crash. On top of this, if you attempt to watch a video while in a call, skype will distort the audio of the video and play increasingly loud static noises until the video is over.How a professional company managed to mangle and ruin an app so absolutely is beyond me. All I know is that I won't be using this app until these app breaking crashes and bugs are fixed."
disappointment,Needs more work,Needs more work. This app needs a lot of work. It won't stop giving me notification sounds even when I turn on quiet mode. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this app compared its counterparts.
disappointment,read this,read this. The update for me wasnt bad. The one thing i dont like about it (this has happened even before the update) is that it never lets me get pictures. I dont know why but also it doesnt always show the messages the people send. That is what i like and do not like but i use it a lot and i would give a four on how well it works for me. 4 stars.

disappointment,New skype,"New skype. I thought it was me being useless but have read the reviews 're the new Skype and,thankfully it's not. I can't sync contacts, or even use the new Skype on my kindle fire,although it's useable on my phone."
disappointment,Skype for Kindle DOES NOT WORK. Garbage,"Skype for Kindle DOES NOT WORK. Garbage. Zero Stars. Skype for Kindle Fire HD simply doesn't work. Connect for a few seconds and then it crashes. There has been no update for a year [Jan 2014~Dec 2014] so obviously neither Amazon, Skype or Microsoft care about Kindle users. If one of the reasons you carry a tablet it to keep in touch, then not having skype is a very real reason to throw your kindle in the bin  and upgrade to another android, or apple based tablet. SKYPE SUCKS."
disappointment,update is horrible,update is horrible. So disappointed with the upgrade. Skype crashes and disconnects every time I try to talk to someone. Needs to be fixed  or I'm switching  to a different app that is more reliable like it was before the update. Skype sucks now :(
disappointment,skype,skype. I have been trying to get this app to work for two days with no results. Why can some users have high praise and so many of us hate this app? Amazon must investigate and share fixes  or insist skype share fixes! I bought kindle fire hd for this reason and am very very disappointed!
disappointment,Update is very disappointing,Update is very disappointing. I know when ever i try to pick up a call it just crashes. i can  make calls or get calls. very disappointed in this.

disappointment,"poor audio, credit card fraud from skype","poor audio, credit card fraud from skype. The audio was horrible with the speakers or the headset.  The video was alright.  Controls, settings are minimal.  2 weeks after I started using skype on kindle fire hd, I had six unauthorized charges on my credit card from skype.  I have used skype on several computers for years, but never purchased anything.  The only way to connect my skype account with my credit card was amazon prime/kindle.  That's pretty sad.  Skype  is removed from my account."
disappointment,Tools work great but loses files,"This app is good at its job. There is still one major flaw. I printed to pdf some things, from my MacMini running Snow Leopard. I chose to encrypt the document with a password. I know the mac is old, so the pdf should have been supported. I get error invalid file. EZ Pdf opens it fine, after putting in password. I do feel the need to encrypt a printout of my network keys, why wouldn't I? I am glad I got this FAOTD. To be an original Apple product, I am shocked! I remember a big point to OS X (back then) was the PDF engine.  I would assume Xcode has this as an option? I don't have any iOS(iTard) devices, I am PRO ANDROID for mobile. Desktop = Mac & OR Linux. I would have been seriously pissed, had I paid full cost for this. I hope they can fix it. As of 9-05-2014. I still don't understand why Google's Play gets updates before Amazon's Appstore?! I complain to Amazon every other month about that. I noticed there is an update right now for PDF Max, but Appstore doesn't have it yet. Changelog Droid is a favorite, that keeps me up to date."
disappointment,Almost there.,"It used to be good, but the latest update 4.6.4 is completely broken. It deson't open PDF on Android 6 (Marshmallow) or 7 (Nogat). Who knows what system the developer has tested on before the release. Mobeera, please update the fix ASAP before everyone switches to other apps!"
disappointment,dont buy it,"I've tried several pdf aps. This one works the best for me. Had to learn the hard way, though, to hit the back arrow when done or all my editing would not be saved. Am able to underline one word rather than the whole line like some apps. But it will often highlight or underline completely out of the area so I have to be really careful not to go past the word and into the margin of the page. Edit buttons are easy enough to access.I have experienced several crashes with this ap using my Kindle 8.9 HD. One time I couldn't go to the previous page without a crash. So I went to the page just before and then to my page. Crash. Used the select a page feature and went to that page, Crash. After an hour it started working correctly.Overall, it gives me what I need and is much better for me than Adobe. Adobe was ok, just not enough features for me. It did not allow you to underline just one word, Had to underline the whole line or between punctuation. Better than ez pdf pro. Edit buttons on that one too small and crashed all the time.This ap is not exactly what I need, but comes closer than others."
disappointment,Poor product,"Can't use at all.  App crashes as soon as file is opened.  It's crap.  Plus, there's no way to get support.  No help file."
disappointment,Waste of money.,"For starters, can't exit app without saving changes--UNBELIEVABLE! Undo button would be nice. And how about a next/previous button to scroll through search results?"
disappointment,will not run on Kindle Fire 10.,"It doesn’t work in my kindle fire 7. It doesn’t open any PDF, not a single one. SCAM"
disappointment,Wasn't what I was looking for,Don't waste your money.  It doesn't work at all.
disappointment,One Star,I could not open any pdf's via this app.  It would just shut down.  Worst money spent.
disappointment,Didn't work!,Errors downloaded
disappointment,Report abuse,why do things always get worse with updates. can be pretty good if it wanted to be
disappointment,Four Stars,Nice
disappointment,Two Stars,Crashes nearly every time!  Rotate your device and it crashes.  Open a PDF and voila 95% chance of a crash.
disappointment,Watermarking not found.,deleted
disappointment,One Star,I made sure this was compatible.  However cannot even open the document.
disappointment,Two Stars,I hate it!! It won't let me open any of my downloads. It just closes and goes back to the home screen. This app is completely non functioning.
disappointment,dont download,lacks expert features
disappointment,app is crap,Man this could be so much better if it wasn't so unstable. Crashes all the time on me. UI is great tho.
disappointment,ok,Need my money back!!
disappointment,Three Stars,"It seems to work out.  Hard to fault, but there's no killer features that give it an edge as far as I can tell."
disappointment,there is now free software which does more and does it better.,It crashes every time I try to open it! Please fix it
disappointment,It's good. The print is a little blurry for a ...,I haven't had the time to explore more fully but it does have a lot of good features
disappointment,It did not work for the document I was trying to work on.,"Here is a quick summary below:Pro:-Very fast pre-rendering of pages at a low-resolution-Large thumbnail pages on the side bar for quick preview of pages before and after the current pageCon:-Problem displaying text boxes created by other PDF programs without re-adjusting the box size (when text border is being used)-Problem displaying continuous fine lines when the page is zoomed out to show the larger extent of the page-Problem locating the annotations correctly created by other PDF application such as EZ PDF.-Lack the ability to adjust font size for typed notes.Device used to try the program: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (10 inch display with 1280x800 resolution)Other full version PDF apps tried before: ezPDF reader, Office Suite, PDF to Go, Polaries Office, Quickoffice, Adobe PDFFULL REVIEW:I have tried many PDF apps before and the one thing I wished most of them have is the large thumbnail display of pages at the side bar like the popular desktop PDF programs such as Adobe PDF and Bluebeam. This features allows users to quickly look up information and have a better sense of where one is at within a chapter. Thus, I decided to give this app a try since I noticed it has the ability to display large thumbnail preview in the side bar.After playing the app for a while, I was disappointed. As listed above, this app has issue displaying text boxes created by other applications. If the box is not large enough it will not show any text inside at all unlike ALL other programs that I have tried. Another disturbing shortcoming is its inability to show fine lines without breaking. I have scanned images of books with tables and charts that appear to have missing borders when  zooming to show the full extent of the page. Worst of all, when loading file with large page size (30"" x 42"" drawing with vector lines generated by AutoCAD or Revit), the drawings become almost unreadable because I can barely see the lines when the page is zoomed out to show even just a quarter of the drawing. Another glaring problem is the inconsistency to display text and object created by other programs. In one instance, when opening a PDF file annotated by ez PDF, half of the texts and annotations are displayed at a completely wrong location. Finally, I did not find any property menu that allows a user to change the font size of the text annotation. The lack of this particular function forces me to cram large text on document with small page size. On the opposite hand, the single sized text annotation on documents with large page format becomes difficult to find.In short, those flaws make the program not the best choice for users who intent to make a lot of typed annotations and wish to open documents with diagrams, tables and graphics (such as textbook and technical documents). And it is a poor choice for those who would like to open large architectural or engineering drawings especially when the drawings were already annotated by other programs before. I will rather stick to other programs for now before those issues have been resolved by the developer."
disappointment,Not for Professional Use Yet,PDF documents look terrible on my nexus 7 / android 5.1.1 due to the awful font used. I can't find a way to change the default font. Not usable for me this way.
disappointment,Its okay.,Doesn't save changes to form fields... Except once in awhile it does.  Worthless
disappointment,Five Stars,Its as alright.
disappointment,Would've been great,"The app is pretty good but the poor rating in because of Amazon. Like all the apps you buy from Amazon, you have to have the Amazon app installed and logged in to use any app you get from them. I do not like to let the Amazon app run just because of all the permissions it wants. I log in when I want to buy an app and log out. Unfortunately Amazon will not allow that."
disappointment,Just use Adobe if you want to read pdfs,"I am a fan of Foxit products usually. But the Foxit PDF Reader for Kindle seemed to suffer from a UI that was always changing. Frustrated, I decided to give another product a try. It's worked out fine. I like this product, and I won't be searching for better. It's reliable and easy to use."
disappointment,this app needs fixing,did not order
disappointment,One Star,"I couldn't get the get the product to work. I intend to return it. I tried to find help in the app and could not.  I tried to find help on google.  Which I am virtually ALWAYS successful at on any question I need answered (and I am a techy).  and although google did answer my question it gave me a simple easy solution to the problem. Don't use the app. Just transfer the file to kindle via email with convert in the subject line. Viola problem solved.So I don't know if the product is any good or not, but I can't get it to work."
disappointment,Cool,"I bought this Android App because I have worked with the iOS version a lot (on my iPhone). It wasn't quite as good as Good Reader (which I use on my iPad and has Dropbox SYNC!) but the iOS version is one of the better PDF annotating apps for iOS. And I have tried many PDF apps on both platforms before.Since they advertise  ""PDF Max is the 5-star rated, full-featured PDF reader used by millions of iPhone/iPad users world-wide and now available for Android""  I was happy to get at least that much PDF functionality for my Android device and went ahead and bought it.BUT BOY, WAS I DISSAPPOINTED!A lot of things that made it great on iOS are simply not there or don't work properrly:- NO TABS for multiple open documents!- Poor file browser which quits when you try to open a document that is located deeply within your folder structure- Slow rendering of certain PDFs (in comparison to the iOS app BUT ALSO IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER ANDROID APPS such as Adobe Reader, RepligoPDF Reader, ezPDF Reader Foxit Mobile PDF etc...- When you select the freehand annotating tool and set its opacity to anything other than 100% it seems to work but after saving it it will be back to 100% and therefore cover any text / element you really wanted to be visible- No step-by-step undo button during highlighting and other annotating tools- Undo button on freehand annotating tool doesn't work most of the time.- Frequent crashes of the app when working with larger size PDFs- Problem locating the annotations correctly created by other PDF application such as EZ PDF.- Lack the ability to adjust font size for typed notes.For anyone that has professionally used the iOS version (or the all time best GoodReader app) this app is unacceptable!It is so not comparable that I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK and if the app would have been advertised in such a way on the Apple App store they would have reimbursed me!Again, even if they advertise it this way, THE ANDROID VERSION IS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE iOS VERSION!In my opinion it is simply NOT READY FOR PROFESSIONAL USE !"
disappointment,Three Stars,good
disappointment,Three Stars,went back to adobe
disappointment,Two Stars,"Downloaded this on a Kindle Fire 8 HD.  No indication it was a ""pay only app"".  No Free trial...  It installed no problem, setup to my printer was easy, but then I tried to print a 1 page document, it said I needed to install and pay for the premium version.  UNINSTALLED.  Got a different FREE app that works.  I don't want to pay $9.95 for something I might use maybe once a month or less..."
disappointment,a-size-base,"It's free to download the app, but if you want to actually use it, you need to upgrade to premium for $4.99. It's not free. I installed it, ran the setup wizard, gave it access to the printer and my files to find out I have to upgrade at a cost, to actually use it.  I am uninstalling frim my Kindle Fire as soon as I finish posting this review."
disappointment,Print from Kindle Wirelessly!,Use of this app is now the only way I can print on my Hp with the Kindle. Hp app is no longer available or useable with Kindle
disappointment,Great product...,Will find out.
disappointment,Easy to use,"Printed without difficulty, easy to use. This was the best app to use with my wireless HP deskjet2540 printer. I tried 2 other HP apps and could not print with my Kindle Fire tablet. I called HP support and was told Hammermill was the app I needed. I only wanted app to print coupons but was unable to print them, per HP support they were receiving reports of problems with mobile devices not been able to print  coupons. I was told mobile devices could not print coupons, due to that I removed app. I will continue to use my laptop to print coupons."
disappointment,Love it!,Not sure what i liked or didnt as it never worked
disappointment,app didnt work,Description of it said it would work???? Did not! Returned!
disappointment,Works great for me printing email,"Claimed to be free but when it came down to the end, we were informed that we needed the ""premium upgrade"" for it to work and there was a charge for that  so I've uninstalled.  Will use something else."
disappointment,Not free,It worked for 1 time then it wants you to pay for an upgrade!!! No Thanks!!!
disappointment,Awesome! Fire HD 8.9,Dry ink.
disappointment,Free download,It horrible it do not work for me at all
disappointment,Unusable with Kindle,Has to download everything to OFF format. Not everything you want to print is downloadable! And now Amazon Kindle Fire has no other options since HP pulled their one click printer app.
disappointment,"I would have to say that this is a great product, unfortunately it did not work for me ...",Waste of money
disappointment,Five Stars,"Great,but has some internal program problems like deleting and gets e-mails on it's own!?"
disappointment,Wireless Printer,"When it works, it works OK. But I have to uninstall and reinstall it every couple of times I use it. The HP plugin works way better, if you have an HP printer."
disappointment,Five Stars,I downloaded this app in my phone and I followed step by step and I couldn't make it work.I will have to try downloading it in a pc or lap top to see if it does work; and I will rated again...
disappointment,No connection,"It's a pay app to use, free download?"
disappointment,good,Finally a simple app to use on Canon all in one printer. Canon posts an IOS & an Android app but not for Kindle
disappointment,what printer,"This makes printing from my Kindle 10 easy. However, it's very slow and I'm not sure if it's the Kindle or my printer."
disappointment,1 happy printer,Never was able to get it to work.
disappointment,Wonderful great app!!!,"When I downloaded to my kindle it looked good, but its an earlier Fire kindle that isn't supported to work with Epson, so it didn't work and I dumped it."
disappointment,User friendly.,It didn't work on my Fire tablet. I have the very first one and the message says it incompatible with my tablet.  Lucky me.
disappointment,How stupidly easy it is to use,Never prints on both sides when that option is selected. Also theres no option to print multiple pages on on sheet i.e. two pages per sheet etc.  Wish it was more user friendly. The help option basically passes the buck and directs you to website. I like it for the most part but it would benefit from adding more print options
disappointment,this one works on my new Kindle tablet,V Could not get it to work
disappointment,Print Hammermill a must have App.,Was not compatible with Kindle Fire.
disappointment,Works great,I have not used this app yet.  It was a free download.  I have not explored how it works or if I can afford it.
disappointment,Review,Did not work.
disappointment,Five Stars,"It keeps wanting me to verify by phone... Put in code hit verify and point, nothing. Can't delete any old stuff that was downloaded so have to sift thru to find stuff. If I could find a help site that would be great."
disappointment,Five Stars,"Deleted, wouldn't work with my Lexmark printer"
disappointment,It works!!!!,You can't print direct from app
disappointment,Finally I can print from my Kindle fire HDX,It is giving me ability to print although it requires some extra steps to get the final print command to the printer.

disappointment,App doesn't work and customer service doesn't respond.,"App doesn't work and customer service doesn't respond.. I'm incredibly disappointed and upset with this app. It stops recording within a few seconds, EVERYTIME. I bought the pro version hoping it would help, but it didn't.

disappointment,annoying,"annoying. I was VERY disappointed with this app. The items are crappy. They also only allow them to be a certain size. They don't let you do feet and inches, only meters. I have had this app for a few months. I deleted it once because it was so hard to get measurements right. I just recently reinstalled it but I am still struggling with how to create a new floor plan without my other plans on the same screen. It gives you a chance to do so every blue moon and because of that I have only 2 or 3 floor plans.

And, finally when you get to the free app...its no better.

WOW!  I don't understand all the POSITIVE reviews for this app.  The app I tried has NO, I REPEAT NO, LIVE content that I can find!  SO basically, in a nutshell, it is USELESS!  I wouldn't expect any network app to provide as much live content (i.e., games) as say the ESPN app, but even NBC and FOX have apps that provide live game content.  As CBS continues it's stranglehold on rights to the men's NCAA basketball tournament, they have the opportunity to provide access to tons of games at the moment, but all the viewers get with respect to alternate games (i.e., games other than the few games aired on CBS's national network) are a handful of games aired on the ""T"" channels (TBS, TNT, and TRUTV).  I assume CBS must own those channels.  ESPN on the other hand has rights to the women's NCAA tournament and men's NIT tournament, and are providing tons of alternate games through their app."
disappointment,Never Works & All About Gambling,"Never Works & All About Gambling. This is the worst streaming channel I have ever used. It usually plays for about a minute, then freezes up and kicks you out. When it actually works, there seems to be only one host, a Greek guy who just gives gambling information as to every game, and the book-makers are the main guests. This is the sleaziest garbage sports network I have ever seen. A waste of money on every level, and a major disappointmentfrom CBS."
disappointment,I bought the CBS all access app because the cbs ...,"I bought the CBS all access app because the cbs .... I bought the CBS all access app because the cbs station in my area has a weak signal and I couldn't get it with my ota antenna....my husband wanted to watch the Denver and the Patriots play.  We tried to turn it on for the pre-game show and lo and behold...not available!  This was nothing special...it was on the network for heavens sake. Sorry, but don't want to try this again. I mean really??  When it comes to live sports..if I can only see it after it's over, who cares??"
disappointment,Don't do it!,Don't do it!. Horrible live stream. The quality of video is like me watching a live game without my glasses while under water. It also has a lag out every play or two.
disappointment,Dissatisfied with CBS APP,"Dissatisfied with CBS APP. Very disappointed with this CBS app. No matter what I'm watching, it might start playing ok, then the picture gets jittery,  and the voices don't move with the lips. If this isn't corrected, I will cancel this!!"
disappointment,Horrible App,"Horrible App. The app sucks! Misleading, when I downloaded, I thought I would be able to watch something that was advertised. I thought I would be able to find it from the landing page, but couldn't find what was shown."
disappointment,DO NOT DO IT!,"DO NOT DO IT!. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. This is worthless. Even with CBS All Access, it does not give you content from CBS Sports Network."
disappointment,No UEFA Champions League Really???,"No UEFA Champions League Really???. Obviously, the people who decided not to show UEFA Champions league have no clue about soccer.  Very disappointed in this streaming stuff.  Show us games on TV please."
disappointment,No live content,"No live content. This app has no live streaming content. I don't know why anyone would want to check scores on their FireTv when we have computers and smartphones. This app seams completely useless to me. Every other major network has some sort of app that allows you to stream all games from across the country, but I can't even watch local games on CBS."
disappointment,mediocre at best,"mediocre at best. Although I haven't used it often, I found it tedious to review the box scores of specific major league baseball games. And the screen was ""squeezed"" with the heading and border taking up unnecessary space."
disappointment,Not what I thought,Not what I thought. It's not what I thought it would be. Just a bunch of commentary when I was looking for a certain  bball game

disappointment,One Star,One Star. No live content. Not worth installing without that.
disappointment,politics or sports.,politics or sports.. Disappointed to be reading a sports story and have the writer go off on a political tirade. Sad thing is he didn't have his facts right. He just wanted to rant I guess.

disappointment,Uninstalled,"Uninstalled. The NFL has now gotten to the point that you can't even listen to the game on your favorite hometown radio station via an internet stream so there's not a whole lot this app can or does do for you for free.The NFL says ""you want real live football or even an audio stream? Get out your checkbook and pay ~$100 per month for our ""Red Zone"" or whatever the package is.<soapbox>The fact that people still have brand loyalty to any given team is understandable and I still pull for the perennially dreadful Detroit Lions but it's hard to see past what a pure, capitalistic business it is sometimes. There's nothing wrong with that - that's called playing the game of capitalism as it's meant to be played - but it's not something you would imagine would inspire face-painting.</soapbox>Uninstalled."
disappointment,Still does not work on Amazon Fire,"Still does not work on Amazon Fire. I made the mistake of updating the foxsports app without reading reviews; now it (the foxsports app) will not load any content. It tries, then gives the ""oops there is an error"" with the options to try again or go back. No amount of 'try again' will work.For the skeptics, yes I have tried: signing out then back in again, uninstalling the app (and clearing all data stored), reinstalling and starting over, sign in/activate. Each time the same result.It simply does not work with amazon Fire. It does still work on Apple tv and on my Ipad (same account).So that tells me Amazon is part of the problem here. Or simply remove the app if it does not work."
disappointment,"Worked only as a ""trial"" temporarily.","Worked only as a ""trial"" temporarily.. Very disappointed...  worked on as a trial for part of the game then asked for login info for TV provider.  What happened to my FireTV app?  And just today I tried again and there are little ""locks"" on all the programs."
disappointment,Picture not as sharp as I imagined,"Picture not as sharp as I imagined. the 4k stream of the superbowl was not as clear as i imagined it would be. several times, especially in motion sequences the picture had some pix-elation. overall it wasn't bad but i would not pay extra for 4k vs hd"
disappointment,Couldn't get the game I wanted to see. It was the featured game.,"Couldn't get the game I wanted to see. It was the featured game.. Was able to get the early game but the Cowboys game that I really wanted to see , I couldn't get it. I was getting a code number to submit but couldn't get it to work. Was disappointed.  First game came in well"
disappointment,NFL SUNDAY,"NFL SUNDAY. The Giants game was broadcast on Fox Sports channel which I get on ATT-Uverse, but the game was not on.  I decided to go to the app to try and get the game, but after installing the app, the only games on were baseball.  Other than that the app is fine."
disappointment,Freezes A LOT,Freezes A LOT. The app for Fox Sports was freezing a lot and would randomly kick me out of the app. It was easier to watch the games from a computer than it was the Firestick. Disappointing.
disappointment,BIG disappointment!,"BIG disappointment!. Critical details omitted!  No where does the description state that you MUST have a TV provider.  If you use a smart TV with an antenna (i.e., you've ""cut the cord"") you CANNOT use this app.!"
disappointment,"You can download the app, but you can't watch football games","You can download the app, but you can't watch football games. The app downloads immediately, but you can't watch sports unless you have a cable provider.  You only get a few minutes of the app before it asks you to input your cable provider"
disappointment,Disappointing,Disappointing. It. Ever hooked up I typed in all the codes n went to the website n it never let me hook up so I missed all the collage football.  The reason I bought the fire stick.  Disappointed!!!!
disappointment,I an not a big enough sports fan to want to watch a game that is already over.,"I an not a big enough sports fan to want to watch a game that is already over.. We thought we could receive current games, games in progress, with the Fox Sports feature, but it appeared to us the feature was for games and news about games that occurred in the past. It appears ESPN+ was about the same thing and we were not interested in it either."
disappointment,Convenient if you are walking away from your TV for a few minutes,"Convenient if you are walking away from your TV for a few minutes. I have to be broadcasting this on my TV simultaneously in order for the application to work on my Fire tablet.  Long pause between actual live content on the TV and what I was viewing during the baseball game yesterday (about one batter behind).  OK, but not great."
disappointment,No 4K,No 4K. 4K does not work.  Perhaps DirectV is blocking it since I don’t have it with my package.  Streaming quality is lousy even though I stream 4K on other services with no issues
disappointment,Disappointed,"Disappointed. Only gives a trial of your viewing then stops service to ask for a provider? I normally get fox sports free over the air however on that night of my game it was storming. I was able to stream over wi-fi internet only to be cut off to no provider info? Big brother I guess? If offered tell what is needed before download, this way I wouldn't have bothered. Watched on computer play by play. They still dont ask."
disappointment,Read before buying!,"Read before buying!. Turns out, you are simply paying for the app. I tried accessing Monday Night Football on my Fire TV and needed to have a TV provider, which we do not have in our home. What I don't understand is it's your TV provider  includes Fox Sports why would you need the app? One would think that when you pay for an app you would have access to it so this was very disappointing and like a scam. This should be clearly stated in the description."
disappointment,Poor streaming quality,Poor streaming quality. Was disappointed with the stream quality. Lots of buffering even over a super fast fiber optic internet connection. Bummer!
disappointment,disappointed,disappointed. i never got to watch any of the sports events i wanted to watch. had stereaming and prime issues that never got reolved.
disappointment,Not as advertised,"Not as advertised. This was supposed to be free and would access the Westminster Kennel Club dog show but every time I tried to see it, it said it wasn't supported through my provider.  Waste of time and big disappointment."
disappointment,unable to find and watch NFL game,unable to find and watch NFL game. Was under the impression we could receive all NFL Games on my Firestick/Fox sports  for free.  Very misleading.  Missed the Washington game - Soooooo disappointed
disappointment,Did not work with my DirectTV Now,Did not work with my DirectTV Now.

A huge disappoint to find local sporting content.
disappointment,Not very so great without a cable subsciption,Not very so great without a cable subsciption. You have to have a cable or TV subscription to get anything out of this. So whats the point of the app. I cut the cord so I wouldn't have to have a subscription and get channels that I don't want to support. This app is useless IMO.
disappointment,Disappointed,"Disappointed. Most all of this I needed a cable subscription, I wouldn't have gotten this if I had cable/"
disappointment,Disappointed,"Disappointed. We don’t have cable or satellite tv, which is why we were trying to sign up for Fox Sports so we could watch our favorite football team play on Sunday. We made it until halftime, but it turns out this was a preview and we needed to log into our tv provider in order to watch the remainder of the game. If we had a tv provider we wouldn’t need to sign up for Fox Sports."
disappointment,Not what I expected.,Not what I expected.. I don't do football and hoped it might show horse racing.  I simply deleted it from the cloud.
disappointment,Can not use this.,"Can not use this.. I was pretty sure going in that this would not work. I do not have cable. I have antenna TV, Netflix, Hulu and an Amazon Fire Box. I do not have a service provider to access FOX Sports. I did get to see some of the USA Women’s Soccer game before being cut off. Sorry for the inconvenience. I have deleted the app frozen m my system."
disappointment,No good without a subscription service,"No good without a subscription service. Didn't know that starting out, but you do get a preview view period of an hour or so.  Would have skipped it."
disappointment,No,No. After installing I was Unfortunately notified the game I wanted to see was blacked out.
disappointment,Poor Choice,"Poor Choice. Thanks but no thanks, your service yesterday just sucked. All I saw was short videos of non-related games. All I wanted was to watch a football game, not covered in my region of coverage, I needed to use other means to see the game I wanted to watch."

disappointment,Not a lot of options for games,"Not a lot of options for games. I have a TV provider and I still was only able to access one NFL game on Sunday. I live in Raleigh,NC and the only option was the Falcons game instead of the Panthers game. I searched for the game and nothing came up either. Pretty disappointed I didn’t have an option to find the game I wanted to watch."
disappointment,Not what I expected,Not what I expected. I didn't realize that the only way to use the app is to have a cable connection in order to view it.  I went to Amazon fire for the purpose of getting rid of cable.  This would also apply to any other apps such as Starz and HBO and others that you can't view unless you have a cable connection.

disappointment,Never got to use it.  :(,Never got to use it.  :(. I was disappointed to get through the process and then it asks for your cable company. That was the reason we bought the Fire Stick was to cut out the cable bill. So I was never able to use it.
disappointment,Very disappointed that they require that information,"Very disappointed that they require that information. We couldn't get the app to work because we don't have cable or satellite or any TV programming that we pay for - except Amazon Fire!  Before it would download, the app wanted a TV provider and Amazon Fire wasn't even an option.  Very disappointed that they require that information."

disappointment,Don't do it,Don't do it. Poor quality

SUPERBOWL, LOL.  Tried to use it to watch the superbowl, it was terrible.  When commercials would load, sometimes it just showed a Fox logo instead of a commercial.  Other times it loaded a commercial but it would lag while trying to load the commercial and freeze on the last frame of the commercial for a few seconds.  During the game it stuttered and dropped frames a bunch of times.  Last year I used the CBS app to watch the superbowl and it was flawless.  Sorry Fox, one star for now, you still have some work to do for 5 star rating."

disappointment,Too expensive and cumbersome.,"Too expensive and cumbersome.. We go fubo for watching European soccer, and it's not worth it.Too expensive. At $45, you might as well get cable with DVD. That's a little more, but you have a lot more options.Too cumbersome. You have to record ahead of time. No on-demand. If you want to watch, e.g. ""La Liga"", you never know what game is going to show at a certain time.While living in Europe, we had dazn for sports streaming. That was less than half the price, everything was on demand (meaning you don't need to plan ahead and record) and you knew exactly which game was showing when. Too bad dazn isn't available here."
disappointment,Worse Ever,"Worse Ever. We have used this service for the last 5 months.  The attraction was getting Redzone, that being said the quality of the broadcasts are poor at best.  We have a 1g Wifi plus the smart tv is connected via Ethernet.  The ability to navigate the home screen with Samsung remote is not intuitive at all.  It doesn’t matter if you record or watch something live, the app seems to buffer excessively.  Watching the Super Bowl put us over the edge.  The picture was highly pixelated and images were indistinguishable.  As soon as our month is over, we are done.  Very disappointed. And it is not cheap.  We are going to do Apple TV."
disappointment,"terrible user interface, unreliable streaming, slow to connect, lower res ""HD""","terrible user interface, unreliable streaming, slow to connect, lower res ""HD"". Boy do I regret believing the reviews on Fubo.  Yes, they have some sports coverage that's hard to get elsewhere.  But it's not worth it.Firstly the user interface is really really bad.  Who designed this thing?  It's clunky, allows very little customization, gives limited information about shows, makes it difficult to change channels, etc. etc.Then you find that it takes some time after you switch to a new channel to get a non-blurry picture.  What?  Are you running this out of your basement, Fubo?And every so often there's an outage.  Unexplained and usually unreported, but there you go, you can't get that stream now.  Has happened to me more than once, and usually right when there was a ""I don't want to miss this"" event.  I've stopped keeping track.Finally, all the so-called HD streams are really at 720p, not 1080p.  There's one ""experimental"" 4K channel, rarely has anything on it.Yeah, I've already cancelled my service, just waiting for the current sub to drain.  (Yes, drain is the right term.)  I'm considering Hulu -- it has most of the channels I want, and works well with Fire boxes. I'll miss the occasional La Liga and Ligue 1 and Serie A matches I was able to catch, but I can't justify Fubo for access to the few games I have time to watch."
disappointment,Not worth the price and poor poor quality,Not worth the price and poor poor quality. Poor quality and takes so long to load. I watched FOX sports North and it only worked for 5 minutes and lost connection.  Went to NBA TV to watch WNBA and same thing.  We watched the first half of a game and after the half time it never came back on until there was 1:00 minute left in the game.  Im on the trial first day and Im already canceling it.  SlingTV Blue with extra Sports is cheaper and more reliable.  DirectTVNOW just added CBS to its line up starting next month (Sept) and all I need is NBC live.  Hopefully FuBoTV will get better.
disappointment,Disappointed with service,"Disappointed with service. I signed up for this App to be able to watch the San Diego Fleet football teams games . After going through the process of signing up, when I attempted to watch the home opener on  Sunday February 17 , your App informed me that that particular game was unavailable. You selling point had been that I WOULD be able to watch AAF games .Very disappointing. I will not continue to use this App .David Cameron"
disappointment,$55 and there are still commercials,"$55 and there are still commercials. For one thing, the least expensive package is $55 and there are still commercials. During the free 7 day trial, I used this to watch the last season of Schitt's Creek before Netflix gets it. For that price, I expected there to be no commercials but there were tons of them. I don't get it. Why pay to watch commercials?I tried to cast it using the app on my phone but the quality was terrible. Using the app via FireTV was much better but the the sound would sometimes not be synced exactly, it would be a little off.I did not use this to watch sports which I understand is their main thing, so in the end this app just wasn't for me."
disappointment,Very misleading.,"Very misleading.. I am away from home for several weeks and my home town NFL team played its opening game on Sunday. I googled 'ways to watch' my team play. Up popped FUBOTV. The add said I could watch NFL games away from my local viewing area, which is true except they pick the teams I can watch, and my home team wasn't one of them. Needless to say, I missed watching my game."
disappointment,Disappointed,"Disappointed. We are very disappointed because we thought we could get all of the NY Giants games (we've lost Fox on Direct TV). It sounded like the game on Sunday 9/22 would be streamed, but it wasn't.  We also found it difficult to navigate the app, but that could be our lack of experience.  All in all, we ended up paying for a month's viewing that we won't use and have discontinued the service. In our opinion, it was a case of false or misleading advertising."
disappointment,Worst resolution of any streaming service available.,"Worst resolution of any streaming service available.. Over priced for the terrible qualify.  Lacking major channels, I couldn't stand the constant blurred, grainy picture.  It looked worse than a 80's home video made by a 5 year old. Not worth the cost. It should be crystal clear resolution not grainy and blurred. Couldn't stand the free trial, canceled. I will not be a fubotv customer."
disappointment,My Mistake,My Mistake. This is the slowest and most difficult app of the roughly 50 downloaded on my Amazon Fire stick. It also did not offer all of the NFL games I was hoping to watch. I cancelled this option after my trial period because I could not believe how few shows it offered. I kept thinking there was something I had missed. It turned out the only thing I was missing was the shows I wanted to watch.
disappointment,Unreliable streaming.  Poor customer service.,"Unreliable streaming.  Poor customer service.. Horrible streaming.  Feed kept losing sound, then freezing, then going to a white screen before sending you back to the fubo home screen.  You have to reset the channel every 5-7 mins.I have fast and reliable internet service and no issues with the fire stick.Customer service only offered a partial refund $20/60.00 USD monthly advanced fee  (which could take up to 2 weeks to come back to me) and to close the account.  They said it could take up to 24 hours for a supervisor to call me back.  Unacceptable.Not worth the money."
disappointment,Not as advertised,"Not as advertised. Signed up to get live NFL games, but was only able to access the same game that I can see locally on my cable. Did not give access to other NFL games on at the same time showing in other regions. Waste of time."
disappointment,This application was a completely disappointment. I downloaded it on my Fire Stick,"This application was a completely disappointment. I downloaded it on my Fire Stick. This application was a complete disappointment. I downloaded it on my Fire Stick, and signed for the free trial, and after that it wouldn't go into the whatever is next. It keep saying: Server error. I really encourage them to first try if the server is available before making anyone going trough the signing process. Really bad user experience. I had to go online after that to remove my subscription. And I tried two times."
disgust,Editing is AWFUL,"Editing is AWFUL. I was trying to watch a movie and was jarred by the cuts to commercial in the middle of sentences.  It' as though they have specific times for commercials, regardless of what's happening on screen.  Very jarring, and caused me to simply leave the movie and the network."
disgust,"Very disappointed, falsely advertised getting my local channels","Very disappointed, falsely advertised getting my local channels. I was very disappointed. I tried several times to get questions answered from their customer service before trying it, and the answered some question but not the ones I asked. After signing up, none of my local channels were available. Lots of sports channels, but none that had the Super Bowl or any NFL for that matter. Also no NHL. Overpriced for what you get in my opinion.  I'll still with Sling Orange."
disgust,Kept freezing up,"Kept freezing up. I tried fuboTV for 3 days with their 7 day free trial.  Very disappointed.  It kept freezing up and we had to wait, wait, wait.  Then I unplugged the Amazon Firestick I used for fubo, plugged my cable box back in and the problem went away with my cable service (with no fuboTV service).fuboTV needs a few more years to get its act together."
disgust,Disappointed I left Direct TV,"Disappointed I left Direct TV. There so many things I dislike about FUBU, I will try to fit everything in this little box.1. The streaming and picture quality and the constant buffering is terrible. We upgraded our internet service, bought a new router and new modem and it's still terrible.2. I tried to save my favorite stations so we don't have to continually go through all the channels to find something to watch, it worked for the first couple I entered but then didn't put the rest into favorites.3. The ROKU remote needs to have an exit button so you can get out of things you didn't mean to press"
disgust,Confused and disappointed,Confused and disappointed. Did not activate.  I wish in the description of these 'apps' it said whether you'd have to pay a subscription fee or be subscribed to a cable service
disgust,"Not bad, just not for me","Not bad, just not for me. The service is too expensive to be considered a cord cutting alternative. I realize it has tons of sports which are not cheap but I still don't think it's a good cord cutting option. The video quality is sub-par in my opinion. Despite having a very fast internet connection, the video seemed to buffer everytime I opened an event. Additionally, the video seemed to lag and get choppy during the fast moving times of sports games or TV. Overall the service is not bad, just not what I was looking for."
disgust,Due diligence,"Due diligence. They advertise all over the internet that you can get access to specific NFL games but when you sign up, they are nowhere to be found.....more costly than actual cable."
disgust,Really bad experience with this service,Really bad experience with this service. Really bad experience with this service. My 3 first recordings did not work so I missed the games. They restored them 2 days after but obviously I already knew the results. Also very poor streaming quality. I hope they improve with time since the selection of sports event is best in market.
disgust,Too expensive,"Too expensive. I enjoyed this service, but in less than a year, they're raising the price $10/month for channels that don't interest me. I am ending my subscription this month as the price is more than my DirecTV used to charge me. Very disappointed and unable to get any response over the phone or via email to customer service. If you sign up now, your cost will increase in August by $10."
disgust,Disappointed,Disappointed. What surprise me was the lack of staying connected. It couldn't have been my wifi because the other streaming apps did not lag or would time out like Fubo app did.  Twice I had to completely restart the Fubo app in order to get it going again.  Not happy whatsoever..
disgust,Not worth the cost.,Not worth the cost.. Cost is just too high.  Not a service I would pay for.  Alot of these live t.v. steaming packages have the same problems that caused me to cut the cord.  Channels I don't want are bundled with few I do at a price I'm not willing to pay.
disgust,It's ok,It's ok. Hate the fact you can't watch a channel while you scroll through another channel.  Also unlike youtube tv on your phone you can't watch it while you are multitasking using another app. Only plus it has the MSG channel.
disgust,Pic quality sub par for sports,"Pic quality sub par for sports. Picture quality for sports not good at all. Worse than youtubetv which is poor as well. Picture looks less than 720 for most sporting events. They only have FOX 4K which isn’t enough to get me to sign up at this time. They also don’t have TBS, TNT, and regional FOX sports networks. Expensive and DVR is limited unless you want to pay even more. Will let free trial expire. May look into it in the future if 4K offerings are expanded."
disgust,Not as advertised,"Not as advertised. The ad said I could watch the game. Yeah, it records the game and you get to watch it after ""the live event"". Then they want $45 a month? I don't think so Tim. I thought I could watch a live game. This app didn't even make 24 hours."
disgust,Too expensive,Too expensive. I found this service to be so-so and too expensive for the price/channels available.  Cord cutting is supposed to be cheaper than the cable companies.  Fubotv makes we want to go back to my cable box.
disgust,SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT,"SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. I did  Free Trial hoping to be able to watch my NFL football team play, since it advertisements say that you can! WRONG! This is not much different than having your regular local TV Channels, UNLESS you want to pay extra for other channels, STILL NO WAY to watch my NFL games!! VERY DISAPPOINTED, CANCELLED FREE TRIAL AN HOUR AFTER SIGNING UP! WASTE OF TIME.."
disgust,Ok but not better than other services,"Ok but not better than other services. I couldn't watch the football games that I wanted.  It is more expensive than my current streaming service, especially for the channels it does or doesn't include.  Not worth the money for me."
disgust,Fubo- not as good as PlayStation Vue.,"Fubo- not as good as PlayStation Vue.. Fubo has the ability to stream in 1080, but other than that, it is pretty primate compared to Slng, DirecTV Now, and PlayStation Vue. The worst part of it is the DVR recording set up. It can only be done using a computer. So far, I haven't figured out how to set up a recurring session. The likely​ reason is because the limit is only 3 recordings. I switched from PlayStation Vue because of a 2 month 40% cut offer from Fubo. After a day of Fubo, I would say 40% off isn't enough."
disgust,Not cheap,Not cheap. They are not any cheaper than cable or Verizon for same number of channels. They should also disclose cost on TV ads. I deleted as soon downloading and seeing the prices on s as fire TV
disgust,Expensive for what you get (and don't get).,"Expensive for what you get (and don't get).. We get way more with Hulu premium, with fewer commercial ad breaks. We cancelled before the 7 day trial period was even over. It might be more worth it if it were less expensive, like a LOT less expensive, say $10/month."
disgust,Not worth $65.00 a month,"Not worth $65.00 a month. I only did the 7 day free trail so we could watch 1 Monday night football game and it served it's purpose. However, $65.00 a month is A LOT of money and it's not worth."
disgust,Expensive,"Expensive. When I saw the cost of Fubo's service, I decided not to continue with registration. I'm sure the quality of the service is fine, but on the expensive side."
disgust,Not worth the money - use Hulu instead,Not worth the money - use Hulu instead. Found this service to be very expensive for what you get.  We cancelled after having a hard time using it for 4 months.  Now we use Hulu and love it.
disgust,Not as advertised!,Not as advertised!. Would not purchase again. Very expensive for channels you don’t really need. They say it works across three devices but I could only get it to work on my cell phone. Wouldn’t work on TV or computer. Beware!
disgust,Not impressed,Not impressed. Very confusing trying to find on demand shows.  Not very user friendly.  Also football game that claimed to be on was no where to be found.

VERY DISAPPOINTED that  the saturday baseball game on MLB network (Boston-Houston) was NOT ON, instead they gave you golf, not just golf but womens golf. How in the hell do you get golf on the MLB network? EPIC FAILURE.  Other than that the site worked almost perfectly, Slight buffering on one movie very briefly. Navigation is a bit akward .  Will most likely join later this year."
disgust,Lack of usability,"Lack of usability. It's UI is just laggy & not very intuitive. The mobile app is a little better, plus 30hrs of DVR storage is lame. YouTube TV gives you unlimited DVR recordings for 8 months or so. Also, no ABC/ESPN/Disney family of channels. And it's too damn expensive for what you get & how polished the Smart TV app is."
disgust,Expensive and it won’t have your game,Expensive and it won’t have your game. This is a very expensive service and it only does what the local tv stations do so you will not have your particular NFL or MLB team if they are not local despite the advertising.
disgust,Still couldn't watch the game,Still couldn't watch the game. Thought I was gaining access to NBA playoffs (Rockets vs Lakers - game 1) but found out that I needed to make additional purchase.  Don't see much here that I will be using.
disgust,Bad quality. Stream cut out in the middle of ...,Bad quality. Stream cut out in the middle of .... Bad quality. Stream cut out in the middle of the game and was never restored. I used YouTube TV instead.
disgust,Doesn't get the sports I want,Doesn't get the sports I want. Too expensive for what I want - mainly because it doesn't get enough sports even though it advertises that it does.
disgust,Very expensive,"Very expensive. With all of the streaming services, I thought hey let me try Fubo.  First this is 65 dollars a month, I can view sports some other way."
disgust,"Not a value for the money, unless you understand Spanish.","Not a value for the money, unless you understand Spanish.. Too expensive, and not a value for the money, unless you understand Spanish.  Couldn't get English titles"
disgust,Too much $$$,Too much $$$. Way too expensive for what you get. I will be cancelling before the end of my free trial. Just not worth it.
disgust,Too Expensive,Too Expensive. Expensive service. You might as well not cut the cord. Also promised local channels were not there.
disgust,Weak and feeble,"Weak and feeble. Offers nothing worthwhile for the price.  Wanted to cut the cable, but this is NOT the choice."
disgust,Poor picture quality,Poor picture quality. I subscribed to Fubo hoping to see an archived Pac 12 game.  Was not able to do this so decided to watch a movie.  The stream didn't lock up but many times the picture was very blurry.  This was maybe due to our lame internet so I may be unfair in my rating.
disgust,False Advertising,False Advertising. The advertisement said I could watch The World Series on this channel but I found out that was not true!
disgust,The name Fubo no longer means soccer.,The name Fubo no longer means soccer.. When I ordered it to get Italian Soccer I was disappointed. ESPN+ is a much better deal for me. You may have different needs but Fubo is throwing in programs you do not need and trying to become a cord cutter.
disgust,Fubo  NONO,Fubo  NONO. Was looking for a replacement service to replace Dish Network. And frankly Fubo is not it. I hate the menu system is no where as easy to use as Dish so for the present will stay with Dish.
disgust,Expendive,"Expendive. Got it to look it over, and decided it's really expensive for me.  If I was a soccer fan, it would be worth it.  But, I am not."
disgust,Disappointed,Disappointed. Add said it was free. Only for a trial period then you have to buy a subscription.
disgust,Meh...,Meh.... Got this to watch NFL games. Never saw a game with it. Deleted it within 24 hours.
disgust,Great App; too expensive though,Great App; too expensive though. The app worked well; however it’s a little expensive. That’s why I didn’t keep it.
disgust,Not what I thought,"Not what I thought. I never watched anything because it is not free. I downloaded it thinking it was, trying to see the playoffs. So of course it gets low marks from me."
disgust,Not What I Thought,"Not What I Thought. I read on my NFL football teams website that a specific game was to be aired on FuBo and they even had the link on their website.  Once I created an account and tried to look for that game, there was no NFL games besides what was on my local channels which that did not help."
disgust,Won't keep it beyhond trial,"Won't keep it beyhond trial. The streaming quality is not good, we can compare with Sling TV. The grid is not very friendly either and there are less oprions than Sling to view past contents on the channels. Plus : recording option of 30 hours and Fox News channel not available on Sling."
disgust,Expensive.,Expensive.. Only problem to expensive for the same as all the other stremming channels.
disgust,Not like hulu,Not like hulu. Not easy to maneuver around and didn’t have the local abc news and weather.
disgust,"Lots of sports networks,","Lots of sports networks,. Lots of sports networks, unfortunately not enough other programing. If you are a sports junkie this might be the channel for you. If you like other programing this is probably not going to satisfy your needs."
disgust,Scam,"Scam. The signal was so weak, the image kept freezing,  until it failed completely and never came back we couldn't finish watching the soccer game. That was the reason we signed up for. A total scam!!!"
disgust,too expensive,too expensive. Not what I expected. Way toooo expensive. Difficult in every way. Sorry
disgust,"It is not free, you have to pay a monthly fee.","It is not free, you have to pay a monthly fee.. It was suppose to be free, but you must make monthly payments..... sorry"
disgust,Good amount of content BUT the app is terrible,"Good amount of content BUT the app is terrible. Good amount of content BUT the app is terrible. There is no search function under shows and movies, terrible categorization. It takes forever to find a show. If you want to watch a show starting with a letter back in the alphabet for you’d have to scroll down forever every single time. No favorites function either. Just downright wayyyy behind today’s standard for an app. Very disappointing, we really wanted to like it but it desperately needs some develepor work."
disgust,Stream tv,Stream tv. No use to me must be signed to a major cable company to watch.  Poor
disgust,Ok,Ok. Rarely use.it. not what I was looking for and streaming can be slow.
disgust,Disappointing,Disappointing. Tried this specifically to watch the Chicago Bears on December 16 and was unable to do so. I cancelled the service.

disgust,Not Quite What Expected!,Not Quite What Expected!. Didn't really stream well and couldn't get the game we wanted!
disgust,No ABC!,No ABC!. I will not be using this streaming app simply because it doesn't offer ABC local. Otherwise the picture quality and channel choices are spot  on. Not having ABC unfortunately  is a deal breaker for us.

disgust,"WARNING: IT'S A WASTE,  DON'T BUY IT","WARNING: IT'S A WASTE,  DON'T BUY IT. I do not recommend this service because even with a great internet connection, the stream kept cutting out or lagging, plus it was always about 30 seconds later than the live broadcast!! Not happy one bit,  very disappointed. I never give a bad review,  I simply choose to not say nothing at all, however, as a paying customer, I would've wanted to know."

Despite a lot of research prior to installing this on my FireTV and Android phone, I was not aware that this app does not allow for the singer's voice to be integrated into the song. This is not what I wanted on a Karaoke app. The only difference between pulling up a karaoke version of a song on YouTube and this app are a few features outlined below:PROS:-wide song selection-easy control of the volume of both the background vocals and the lead singer on the track-use multiple devices so singers can queue their own songs-not a bad price if you just want to subscribe a weekend every month or so and you need these featuresCONS:-the app is not designed to incorporate the karaoke singer's voice into the track as it plays"

The app is perfectly reliable and pretty intuitive to use.Two complaints for the developers.1) The manual panning controls are bad enough to be useless (I have two Foscam cameras). The controls basically only go all the way up, down, left, or right and offer no fine tuning. Fortunately, I rarely ever need the panning controls, but it would be nice if they worked when needed.2) Recording of videos does not record the audio with the video making the video recording feature pretty meh."

disappointment,Four Stars,1
disappointment,One Star,Didn't download
disappointment,Wish it was worth it,Not worth it unless you want to view places that are no where near you nor do you even care. Thought I would be able to see places that I care to see and the video is that of the free cameras that are on buildings and located in public places. You dont need this app to see this.
disappointment,James Hawkins,"love the product. Does exactly what it promises.  Unfortunately, it does slow down network speed."
disappointment,So so,Um ok I guess not too impressed
disappointment,One Star,Didn't like it
disappointment,One Star,Not what I wanted.
disappointment,good FOSCAM application,Works very well but only supports 1 way audio on FOSCAM cameras.  Would give 5 stars if it had this function.
disappointment,One Star,This doesn't really work
disappointment,Four Stars,It was cool...I guess.
disappointment,Does not work with Nest cameras,I read online that you could use this app to stream all of your Nest security cameras on a single screen with FireTV. That is not the case. This app does not work with Nest cameras since the migration to Google apparently. App is non-refundable so it was just a waste of money for me.
disappointment,One Star,bad

disappointment,ntu,not recoved
disappointment,It's alright having the software as long as you have the knowledge to go with it,Seemed like it was a good program but after installing it. On my system it would not connect my camera to my phone or tablet 😞😞
disappointment,Two Stars,Not what I wanted
disappointment,Not value for money,"I made  an error saying I paid for another app, which was free, this is the one that cost about £2.5 and only shows one cam its not easy to work and poor, considering I can watch four of other peoples cams on it but not my own, and on a free app off another provider the app lets me see my four cams on line nicely"
disappointment,How to get more than one camera,"I d/l the free version to try it out but could only get one of my 4 cameras to show up so I bought the Pro version hoping it may be a 'Free' restriction but same issue.I have a Kare CCTV with 4 cams, I have various tablets and PCs showing them around the house but Tiny Cam seems to be the best reviewed one for running on an Amazon Fire tablet.I scan the network and it comes up with LocalHost, when I add it,I only get one of my cameras. I've tried changing the Channel number to 1,2,3,4 but still only get camera 1.Now installed XMeye for free and worked straight away.."
disappointment,Out of date and not working,"I have a Neos smartcam. tinyCam PRO website shows latest version supports this. The problem is that Amazon's version is about 3 versions back from that, so I paid for something that does not work :("
disappointment,Check that your camera is supported...........,Check that your camera is supported before buying this. I didn't therefore a complete waste of time and money.

disappointment,One Star,Had it not been free I would want my money back.
disappointment,Doesnt find DVRs only public cameras.,Doesnt find DVRs only public cameras.Their Promo Ad is totally misleading.
disappointment,review,Poor.Not enough cameras that matters hence the low score a little to much likes spying.
disappointment,I was extremely DISAPPOINTED!!,DON'T get because it is RUBBISH!!I was extremely DISAPPOINTED!!!😭
disappointment,Surprised,Downloaded the app on my tv and phone; however nothing happened. Didn’t even open🤷🏾‍♀️
disappointment,Need to buy the upgrade software in order to get the most out it and that doe not say much,"Install this on my Kindle Fire and Iphone since Apple and the NOT so Smart TV were compatible with the screen mirroring function of the phone.  The operation calls for you to login to a wireless network (you don't have one, you out of luck with this software) both phone and TV must be on the same network to work.  The picture quality in on par with the old old old sets, you need to buy the upgraded software to get a better image.  Needless to say I uninstalled the software and said good bye.  End of Review and Don't even think of installing on a Iphone."
disappointment,Performance issues,You need to install a companion app into your smart device then there was quite a lag in performance even though it had a strong 5G WiFi connection on the tablet.  The FireTV Cube is a wired connection to the network.Deleted the app after I could t improve the performance.I was looking to an alternative to AirScreen but will continue to use it until I find a viable replacement.
disappointment,Not the best for streaming movies- no sound,This was easy to use but had connectivity issues and kept dropping the picture. SOUND cannot be picked up and we planned to use this to stream a digital movie so we had to run the sound from the phone. Picture was a bit delayed. Would not recommend for this purpose but maybe for photos?
disappointment,Not a great app - the mirroring doesn't work well,Tried mirroring some videos from my phone to my TV...it just didn't work well. Very poor picture quality and lots of lag. Wouldn't suggest it.
disappointment,This product is very BAD!!!,It does not work!  Please send it back to the software develops to re-create. Please do NOT release something to the market when it is NOT ready. I am very disappointed with the Amazon product... shame on you!
disappointment,Nice mirror imaging from phone but lacks sound.,Wanting something to mirror my phone so I can see it larger. Video quality is fine but there is no sound. I’m hearing they’re working on that and if they accomplish it will be a better app. Otherwise fine for images
disappointment,How do I get a refund?,"Since the Firestick  does not offer it, I bought this to mirror while using the “Peacock” app for my iPhone. It does the mirroring until I start the movie. I get everything in my screen but the movie. I want my money back."
disappointment,Misleading functionality,It doesn’t work with all apps on the iPhone! Unfortunately I read the reviews on that too late . I never got a chance to use it. 👎🏽
disappointment,It may not work for you. Impossible to know until you buy it.,"Depending upon the age of your tv, and if you are using a fire TV vs Fire Stick, there can be issues. I could not get my AT&T TV to stream from my phone to the television which is why I wanted it. Maybe for another use I would've rated it much higher."
disappointment,FALSE,App does not do what it appears to state it does. Additional Charges are not stated at the time of purchase.  Not worth the price
disappointment,Yes but not for me,It worked ok but I just can’t see paying $1.99 per week to cast Facebook or whatever from my phone to tv. Not that serious
disappointment,This was a pretty pathetic app,I downloaded this app on my Sony TV so I can attempt to stream an online video from the website. It kind of worked. It was a bit sketchy. And it did not allow me to go to a full screen mode.
disappointment,"Pretty good video, but....",...No sound!  Even their FAQ w/in the App confirms no sound yet.  I bought this in a pinch and assumed there would be audio.  Watching a video on your TV while listening to the sound thru your iPhone isn’t all that great.  Buyer beware...shame on me!
disappointment,Don't waste your time unless your ok paying for the app required to mirror from device,"Was really disappointed to see that the Amazon presented this as a no-cost on Fire TV and then when scanning the QR code for the app to mirror, it isn't free and the reviews are terrible..."
disappointment,Good scanner,The paid version days it always find garbage & viruses
disappointment,Hmm...,Would like to be able to see what is being removed from my Kindle.  Also wish that there was a risk free trial to use the app and not purchase if it doesn't seem worth the price.
disappointment,Not actually free,It won't even clean anything unless you pay.
disappointment,One Star,this wasn't what I thought it was and am glad it was free.
disappointment,Not really free but works,"To clean the garbage off your device, you must pay. Does a good job"
disappointment,I thought it was Free,It's not Free
disappointment,Why,It is a waste because you have to pay each time you use it
disappointment,What a crock!,I think this app is a scam. I ran it several times and the numbers never change. What a crock!
disappointment,Deceptive,This app will analyze your kindle fire then ask for $4.29 to download the cleaner.
disappointment,Disappointed.,Not what I expected. Disappointed.
disappointment,Works well,This app appears to work well. You only get the scanner portion for free. In order to actually clean you need to buy the full app via IAP.
disappointment,you get what you pay for,Not the worst I've ever usef
disappointment,Two Stars,did not help
disappointment,Not free to repair!,Only analyzes but not repairs unless you buy the app.
disappointment,Free App.,I used it.  Not sure if I can tell any improvement.
disappointment,One Star,Says it's free then you have to pay.
disappointment,A little disappointed 😞,Was expecting more from the reviews and advertising. A little disappointed by how little the app does.
disappointment,One Star,Didn't like it Removed from my phone
disappointment,"You have to buy it to have it do any cleaning, but they don't tell you that part.","Took about 3 seconds to ""scan"" my entire tablet without any mention of what it is doing.  That was the first red flag.  When it ""finishes"" it doesn't detail absolutely anything it found.  Just ""31 MB of garbage and 7 virus files"".  That was the second red flag.  And to round it out, you have to buy it to do anything close to ""cleaning"" it.  What a rip off.  Sure, they say it offers in app purchases, but they fail to tell you that if you want anything useful like, oh, say, CLEANING THE JUNK, you need to buy it.  Oh, and 'Support Team', don't bother replying to this with your standard reply about how it's really doing 'this' or 'that'.  You misled people, and you only get one chance at a first impression.  And you blew it."
disappointment,rip off not worth the star,Tells you free download and after running scan it does nothing until you buy iy
disappointment,One Star,"The optimizer works, but then says buy the cleaner now!! Total bunk!"
disappointment,Works ok.,Seems to work okay. No improvement in speed yet.
disappointment,"Nice, but basic",A nice app but somewhat useless without the cleaner.
disappointment,What does it do?,Don't really know what is doing. Each time it is used it tells me that there are viruses when other apps tell me there are none.  It really doesn't do much else.
disappointment,Handy App,It's a handy little app but it doesn't do everything. Had to get other apps to finish the cleaning process.
disappointment,1st time i used it.,It said I had 0Garbage And did nothing
disappointment,Disappointed,Doesn't help my Kendall Fire.
disappointment,Nice app,Easy to use but you need to upgrade to clean.
disappointment,Somewhat less than very helpful.,Not much to like in the free version.
disappointment,Simple and useful but not free,I liked how simple it was but was bummed to pay a$4.50 for the actual cleaner when it wasn't advertised that was going to be needed. But it's probably worth that for keeping things running smoothly so easily.
disappointment,It's ok,"Seems pretty good, I only run  it occasionally because kindle tablet not very good.. to used to Android that works and plays well with others. But the cleaner does it's job not very many choices anyway.."
disappointment,misleading,Very misleading.  You must purchase the product if you want it to do more than a scan.
disappointment,One Star,"It was free to download, but to clean you had to upgrade"
disappointment,Ok,you have to pay if you want to clean your device.
disappointment,Seems ok,"There aren't very many apps to help optimize or clean a Kindle. I am sure it's doing something, however is not something that you immediately notice."
disappointment,Two Stars,Not that great
disappointment,One Star,It was not free
disappointment,don't like,it sucked wanted me to buy another one to finish cleaning
disappointment,piece of crap,Loaded app and went to try it and it didn't work.  Amazon should be ashamed.
disappointment,Don't bother!,Not worth trying
disappointment,Not for me,Not what I wanted.  Deleted it.
disappointment,Deceptive inoperable till you pay $4.99,Deceiving not free won't operate until you pay $4.99  So the app is installed but it's not free to use
disappointment,Not working,I downloaded it and it cleaned zero garbage
disappointment,Viruses?,"Not sure if I like this. First time I used it, it found one virus and then I used it again the next day without doing anything on my tablet between this time and the second time it found 6 viruses. Not sure if that is accurate and it won't show u what it believes is the viruses. Def could be better. ..Update: got rid of this. I would scan back to back and the amount of viruses varied. The first scan would say 4 and I would scan again right after and then it would say 7 found viruses.."
disappointment,Jokd,What a joke. It teases with a short scan and leads you to a product purchase in order to solve anything.
disappointment,One Star,"Doesn't work unless you buy the upgraded version,"
disappointment,Ok,It seems to help my Kindle run a bit smoother but not as much as I had hoped it would.
disappointment,Always the same results.,Not sure it is doing anything.  The results are always exactly the same.
disappointment,One Star,It doesn't work. It doesn't remove anything. It just tells you what needs to be removed.
disappointment,One Star,Not what I expected just a tool to get more money.
disappointment,Adequate,Decent app that's freeLimited in options
disappointment,Ok garbage cleaner. But that's all it does.,Don't feel that it's that good of a product for 4 or 5 stars. Others apps offer much more for free.
disappointment,Useless,Don't waste your time.
disappointment,Not sure,"Says it is clean, then I run it again and more needs to be cleaned.  I don't know if it is working."
disappointment,So so,"Its OK, won't clean  all, that shows  needs cleaned. Wish I hadn't paid for it. A waste of my cash."
disappointment,Just did not work,You have to pay for a pro version.🙁🙁
disappointment,What's the point,This does nothing but tell you to download their cleaner app.
disappointment,Just a come-on to requiring purchase of Cleaning tool,"Does an analysis, then suggests you buy the tool to implement necessary clean-up; stick with CCleaner instead."
disappointment,Just Got it,I will rate it higher when I am able to see that it works. I don't like that it wants you to rate it just to get free updates...
disappointment,After you use it it gives you the option to ...,After you use it it gives you the option to buy an actual cleaner. But it doesn't actually clean the viruses it just recognizes them
disappointment,Junk... Don't waste your time...,"Wouldn't clean anything without buying full package. Said I have 13 viruses, but another security app detects none"
disappointment,Did not like!,Did not like!
disappointment,Useless,Useless. It require purchase after scan.
disappointment,Poor app,This app requires a purchase upgrade to actually work.  I do not recommend.
disappointment,One Star,It didn't clean any trash so I deleted it
disappointment,it's just ok,"Not sure how effective it is because it tells me every day I have virus files then removes them, I guess"
disappointment,not free,"Free scan, but 5 bucks to clean"
disappointment,Works well,Works well. Very efficient but a little pricey.
disappointment,Essentially an ad for the paid version,Developer needs to make this a timed trial version and display which files it intends to delete.  I would then consider purchasing this.
disappointment,It does okay.,I don't really see a lot of difference after using it. But I do not use my tablet much anyway.
disappointment,Placebo,"This app seems like a placebo.  It's always coming up with three viruses and a bunch of 'garbage' to remove, but never seems to actually DO anything. Constantly interrupting with 'additional tool's the developer wants you to install. Goodbye."
disappointment,Works,Wish it worked stand by.
disappointment,Not impressed this far,"Well do far it hangs, and I'm starting to think that this is a phony app especially since it comes in two parts. Scanner free then pay for the so called cleaner which hangs.BOTTOM line not IMPRESSIVE, will redo if things change...."
disappointment,Don't know what happened!!!,Can't really say.I purchased and downloaded says it ran scan but now it's gone from my Fire.
disappointment,One Star,I sent it back.
disappointment,Confused,Not sure if it works.  Don't see a difference in speed
disappointment,Device cleaner,Awesome! But you have to BUY the app to be able to actually clean your device. It isn't free....only the scan!
disappointment,Results????,I cannot determine if this app did anything at all.
disappointment,Unhappy,"App is not working the way it was advertised.. Run scan, then clean, then scan again  same numbers of trash appears  wish I had my money back, I also don't understand why it says free, then to use it, you pay $4.99. I am not a novice user, but I thought free download meant free usage also."
disappointment,One Star,Does not work on my unit.
disappointment,Not free after all,"Says ""free"" when you download it but it's not. You get charged once to do a scan.  My kindle still runs slow and freezes. Not so sure it's worth it."
disappointment,Not Sure,I'm not sure why I paid so much for this app.
disappointment,WASTE OF TIME,Doesn't seem to improve nor change anything!
disappointment,Does it work? Yes and NO,"Yes for a little cleaning. But overall you have to look at what it wants to erase! One time on the 3rd time running the app it came up withover 6 Gigs of what it said is trash! The stuff was all of my Videos and Pictures! Almost would have lost some pictures not backed yet. ButI am keeping until I can find a program that gives my Kindle a boost, which for now is this app. 😏"
disappointment,Don't bother they want in app purchase as soon as you load it,bait and switch looking for immediate in-app purchase bummer
disappointment,Does the trick!,Cleans minimum garbage files. Room for improvement.
disappointment,Not worth a download,"If you do down!and, remember to leave a review before you uninstall it.And you will uninstall it. So did i."
disappointment,indifferent,I don't feel as if it's done anything bad.  But I can't tell if it's done any good.
disappointment,Good enough,"Kind of lures you in with free scan and makes you pay for the app. Upfront cost info would've been better. I wasn't  looking for a free app just a good one. Have used and don't really see a difference but time and repeated use may tell. Three stars for bait and switch, costs around 4.50, so not a lot, but would prefer a free scan to see if this even worked. Also, says rate for free updates, so yeah this is kind of iffy."
disappointment,I wish it just would have warned me in app purchase REQUIRED,Not quite as great as I expected
disappointment,Works,Works alright for what it is. Asks for additional purchase.
disappointment,One Star,"Requires to be purchased after you install and use it, not free."
disappointment,Okay app,Works well but not free. Had to spend money to remove stuff
disappointment,Made little difference.,Only made slight increase in speed.
disappointment,all adds DON'T,all adds DON'T clean
disappointment,Have to Pay to See if it Works,Nothing free here; just a teaser scan and an offer to buy. No idea if it really works.
disappointment,Not fully free.,"Only the scanner is free, ended up paying for the cleaner."
disappointment,Optimizer,Good optimizer but have to buy trash cleaner not good
disappointment,Another computer con,Does not do anything special just deleted some old files.
disappointment,Works well,Free version is ok. Limited in it functions
disappointment,Not free,This is a free trial only.
disappointment,In not sure this actually works.,I don't think this works.
disappointment,I found others better,It was ok. Not good but ok
disappointment,Overall good cleaner.,"Not the best, by t not the worst. Overall middle of the road decent junk cleaner."
disappointment,Is ok,"It cleans fast, but says suppose to help speed up your tablet but I can't tell any difference"
disappointment,Worked as advertised,You have to purchase it
disappointment,not free,not free
disappointment,Wondering,"Fast. However, when I use a second cleaner app, it always finds m malware and viruses."
disappointment,just a scanner,Have to buy the cleaner app.  I did and it didn't work.
disappointment,Do,Does not do much
disappointment,Ok App😪,It's an o.k. App. There are better one's though....
disappointment,Not a great optimizer,"Not a great optimizer. I wish I could find a better optimized for my kindle. This one has not improved speeds for the different apps at all. It also doesn't give much information for what's on your hard drive when it analyzes or when it 'optimized' by deleting files. Also I see no defrag option, so it doesn't optimized very much at all overall."
disappointment,Optimiser cleaning for fire,"Works well at cleaning garbage out of cache, however cliché in spots!"
disappointment,Three Stars,Still looking for a great one.
disappointment,Useless,Useless. Got rid of it.
disappointment,Good and not good,It is good supposedly cleaning and wants the to buy products lol . you can do Better.
disappointment,Works,worked well. But $5 for it to clean it
disappointment,Worth the money,"Seems to find viruses, but don't notice any performance improvement after running and cleaning. Does well clearing garbage files."
disappointment,misleading wording at its best..,"The apt is advertised as free....misleading wording at its best...This is one apt that lies about the product.because if you don't pay, it won't do its job!"
disappointment,It seems to have sped it up.,"I didn't do much with the initial free download of this.  I did purchase the upgrade.  It downloaded quickly and so far works very well.  It found a few things on my Kindle and cleaned them up for me.  So far, I'm pretty happy with this app.  The cost for it was minimal and well worth buying.I have found that over time this program doesn't do as well as it did at first.  I am inclined to think the rating should only be two or three stars."
disappointment,ON given the limited Amazon selections,"I wish that Norton Clean App was available for Amazon Fires. This app is free to identify issues, but I couldn't get to any clean function without first paying 4.29. Also underwhelmed that after I bought it from one Fire, I had to go back to the store to get (not pay) it for our other Fires as it won't list in My Apps for some reason. After you run it, which seems to be fine, you get ads for other--possibly competing apps--even after you dropped 4.29. You'd think that the bought version would stop blasting ads at you."
disappointment,A  General maintenance,"Good cleaning options, however, it finds the same 10 virus at every cleaning."
disappointment,Don’t get,Did not work at all
disappointment,NO Floating Windows,I had to pay another 3.99 for the same app I've already paid for expecting the same functionality. But the floating window feature is not working...
disappointment,Great product,Great product had to get this because ip cam didn’t work as they said
disappointment,Don't spend the money!,"Waste of money, not user friendly!  Will not recognize my cameras."
disappointment,Meh,"Glad I didn't pay for it.  Its 'ok' but I guess its not something I really needed.So, neither positive nor negative."
disappointment,Don't want it,Want to cancel this now. Not  what I was looking for
disappointment,Hobbled by Amazon,"It won't work with android wear watches. Which is why I purchased it. The description says it works with android wear watches. However, I get a pop-up that there is a bug with Amazon DRM protection. I don't like to give this a low reading, since it isn't the developers fault (if purchased from Google Play Store, it evidently works without a hitch). However, it still does not work as advertised."
disappointment,stinks,doesn't do what it said it would do
disappointment,good multi camera app,allows for multiple camera views at once controls are usable but does not scan Lan accurately does not detect my camera
disappointment,Won't connect most of the time,"I bought this app as it appeared to be the most downloaded and highly rated. Unfortunately, it won't connect most of the time. Instead, I get a ""video failed"" message. It's DEFINITELY the app that's the problem - the Foscam IP viewer app on my iPad and the Internet on my Kindle Fire both connect just fine. Very disappointed the app doesn't work, and that I'm out $4."
disappointment,Didn't work,Did not connect with my camera
disappointment,.,Did not work for me
disappointment,therefore it's useless for me,"It doesn't support Zmodo, therefore it's useless for me."
disappointment,Battery life is only 4 to 6 hours max,The size is very cool and extremely small. But the battery life is very short. 6 hours max. Plus I went through 5 apps before one app was able to hook up to it. I do like it for my front door. But sorry to say. It's just not working for me. The battery life of a RING camera is 30 to 90 day's. On this camera is sad. Only 4 to 6 hours max..
disappointment,One Star,Does not work with alot of Foscams
disappointment,Works well for me.,Have four foscam cameras.
disappointment,Three Stars,Many of the cams do not work.
disappointment,Disapointing. Did not work with Lorex cameras.,"Would not work with my Lorex camers, which is the reason I purchased it.The application saw them in the scan but could not open them, this was while I was on the same local network, so remote viewing is definitely out of the picture.  I wasted my money on this application."
disappointment,Two Stars,Not worth it
disappointment,Horrible app,This app does not work as advertised. It will also not support a DVR type of camera system. Don't waste your money
disappointment,Sucked,Sucked
disappointment,Two Stars,not so good.
disappointment,Works well,Works well for my Axis camera. Doesn't support my FLIR camera.
disappointment,One Star,This is not working the way I was hoping it could
disappointment,Meh,"Meh, no point"
disappointment,Cameras drop a lot,"I love being able to watch all my cameras at the same time. I've had the app for a few weeks now, it was pretty good app but now with th new update the camers drop a lot and some frame freezing.  Hopefully a new update will fix this small error."
disappointment,One Star,does not work as suggested
disappointment,ok,"Show the place is not my location,so funny !"
disappointment,Four Stars,Timepass
disappointment,Not for the novice,"not for the novice who has never tried something like this before, would not recommend it."
disappointment,cannot view my cameras on Kindle Fire HD,I have a kindle Fire and am trying to be able to view my surviellence camera the same way I do with my droid phone.  This app does not work with my Kindle Fire
disappointment,IPCam Iis a much better product.,"Difficult to setup,never got it to work properly.IPCam Iis a much better product."
disappointment,So far so good,"I download this app for my FireTv.So far so good, very easy to set up.I wish there was some kind of configuration to make de video look better, the quality is very low..... but is better on my Samsung s10e. dunno if there is some limitations, also while the video is almost instant, the audio have a very good 45s delay.I using 3 Wyze camps, TinyCam on my Sansung look great, on the Wyze app look great, but on the fire TV feels like 480~720p."
disappointment,Failed to display Wyze and Simplisafe cameras,"I could not get this app to display my cameras installed and working on my home wifi network.  Cameras work fine with Wyze and SimpliSafe apps.  I wanted to consolidate the view and there seems to be no way to cancel the order for Tiny Cam Pro, disappointed in app and Amazon."
disappointment,One Star,its not working fully as needed..  sorry
disappointment,Version out of date,"I have used the Free version for over a year and it works great with my cameras.  I decided to purchase the Pro version because it offered ""recording"" capabilities over the snapshot function of the Free version.  Well, recording is not a video stream, it is just a series of jpg snapshots.  Not worth the upgrade as my cameras don't support motion detection or sound.  Oh well...Update: App now supports actual video recording.  But I am reducing the number of stars because the version of this app on the Amazon app store is at least 3 versions behind Playstore."
disappointment,One Star,Will not work on LG 2 sorry I got it .
disappointment,Recommended Update,The two older TRENDNET cameras we have (TV-IP 512WN) works great on the home network and via Inernet.  We purchased two additional TRENDNET cameras (TV-IP 751WIC and TV-IP 851WIC) that are not currently supported.  We were able to use the TV-IP 551WI setting with encrypted password to view both cameras on the home network but can't view via Internet.  Would like to see support on these cameras on the next update.
disappointment,Even Sricam cameras can manage their movements easily. However Starcam refresh time is about 1 second,"I have 2 brands of cameras, Starcam y Sricam and both work with the application. Even Sricam cameras can manage their movements easily. However Starcam refresh time is about 1 second, so the video seems slow"
disappointment,does not work with alarm.com cameras,this does not work with alarm.com cameras. if they do i have not been able to find any documentation or tutorials anywhere for it. I wish they would let you try it before you bought it.
disappointment,"Good program, lack luster support.","Does a great job showing and controlling cameras.  Contacted support to have h264 support for my 933L.  They wanted to access the camera.  I set up a guest account, then they disappeared.  They have it for other models in the same line and their compatibility document says it is supported.  Without it, streaming is very slow.  So double check your compatible cameras.  Would give more stars but..."
disappointment,"Runs terrible on Fire TV Stick with HD cameras, acceptable on Gen I Fire tablet","Don't see too many reviews of this app for the 1st gen Fire TV stick and specific camera models so adding my experience here. Bought the app since I had good experience with it before on a 2012 Nexus 7 with Foscam 8910W (480P) cameras.Fast forward a few years and i've since added Foscam 9821 (720P) and Amcrest IP2M-841 (1080P) cameras as well and thought over the weekend that it would be nice to be able to see the cams on a large TV via the Fire TV stick.Checked the amazon app store and saw that the app is listed as compatible so without hesitation I bought it given the good experience before. First the good, the scan feature is very good and picked up IP addresses, custom ports, camera make, model correctly for the most part so all I had to do was confirm cameras and enter user name and password. There was a bit of a learning curve to using the fire tv remote to navigate but do able.Now the bad, the 480p cameras worked fine as expected getting about 14-15 fps which is in line with MJPEG camera frame rates; video is reasonably smooth. The 720p cameras were disappointing at 9-10 fps, we're in choppy video territory here now. The 1080p camera was inexcusably bad at ~4 fps, we're talking someone walking across the room looks like they are teleporting 3ft forward at a time. This is all using the built in app's hardware acceleration setting.I reached out to support and he advised that the Fire TV is slow hardware and essentially to lower my resolution on the camera or get better hardware like an Nvidia shield. The Fire TV stick while slow overall can play 1080P videos from Amazon, Netflix, Plex, etc so I think I was somewhat reasonable in my expectation that H264 cameras would work fine with the hardware provided but I guess I was wrong.I will try limiting the app to one camera next to see if that improves the performance.Edit Mar 2017:Removed all the 480P cameras and now only have 2 cameras connected to the app: one 720P Foscam and one 1080P Amcrest, FPS has now improved when in full screen mode: 720P camera fluctuates between 6-10 FPS but seems to stabilize out around 10 FPS, still choppy video overall but usuable as a baby cam and not for any kind of detailed viewing/recording, 1080P camera seems to stabilize around 14-16 FPS and under low motion appears reasonably smooth but again not what you'd want for detailed viewing/recording.When both cameras are on screen in the multicam view, both slow down to about 7 FPS and basically unusable past the point of a series of slow moving pictures but if all you need is any kind of visual like a camera in the garage to verify if the door is open or closed....it'll do.I have the app running on 2 1st gen Fire TV sticks bought at the same time; one seems to like the HW+ decoding better and the other does better in HW mode. Same app, same generation hardware, same cameras, perhaps there are hardware differences inside?The moment I try adding the 480P cameras back in the mix, performance suffers again. I also tried using with just the 1080P cam and it only picked up another 1-2 FPS.Installed the app on a Gen I Fire tablet as well and using with only the 1080P camera in HW mode, am getting 30 FPS in daylight but expect that IR performance at night will likely suffer as well.Conclusion: use with 2 H264 cameras at most on a Gen I Fire TV stick and Gen I Fire tablet. If you have the hardware already like I did, it's ok value to get a little bit of extra utility out of them."
disappointment,Five Stars,Free app of the day at that time.Very tiny
disappointment,cameras not listed and cannot get it to work,"Even though there are updates quite often, my 2 year old brickcom ip camera isn't listed and unable to use it with this app. I will contact the developer for help and then I will update my reviewOtherwise the app has a nice interface."
disappointment,NOT 4 Windows,After buying I find out that this was NOT for Windows. Should have been stated in the description.
disappointment,unhappy with the pro version on Xoom running icescream  Sandwich,no pan and tilt control for my foscams wireless and Panasonic bl230a cams.  no way to turn on/off IR on the foscam.  my brother recommended this because it has all these features on his android phone and he is using the free version.  I paid $3.49 and got less of an app for my Zoom.

I have tried to change my password but don't receive the code on email or my phone. Microsoft has been in bed with the NSA in helping them spy on law abiding citizens in the past and I am sure they are still doing it. If only there was an alternative I would relegate this app to the virtual dung heap. Amazon, you really need to create an alternative app . Microsoft screws up everything they touch if Skype is an example."

distrust,Five Stars,Good if a little stalkerish
distrust,Had to remove once downloaded as it is not a free APP as I requested,App should be clearly noted that it is not free so that customer will not be surprised once the APP is downloaded just to find that their is a cost to use the feature.

distrust,Not sure yet,I'll update when I figure out if it's just trying to get me to spend money.
distrust,Buyer beware,"It appears to be a random number generator for the number of viruses found rather than actually finding viruses and removing them. No report at the end on the actual viruses removed, just a summary of the size of data held by your apps.  I tried it after not using the device for a day and it generates 4 viruses found. Clean it and try it again later that day, no viruses found. Go to the next day with no other usage and 7 viruses found. Clean it and try it again later that day, no viruses found. Go to the next day with no other usage and 3 viruses found. And on and on....  Seems like it's phony and just randomly generates a number each day.  Also doesn't have any place where you can update for the latest virus database so appears to be a scam."

confusion,A teen with a tablet,"A teen with a tablet. As someone who is well versed in the world of gaming, the lag is terrible. I've played it in multiple locations each a different wireless range and the lag is the same across the board. Considering that I use a 4th gen Kindle Fire HD; this troubles me. With the fact that the tablet I use is a quad-core; I shouldn't have this much lag in any scenario. I am glad at least that the game itself is free and I understand that the developers have to make some money. But I will not deny my distaste of the game's favoritism to the pay-to-win faction. As for the advertising; once again I understand that in order to get such a game out there, it takes quite a bit. But I think that Arnold Schwarzenegger was a bit overkill. My advice to the developers: try the Linux approach. It's not supposed to be about the money. It's supposed to be about bringing people together to have fun. If the game were truly equalized; I know for a fact that the game would gain more positive reviews at a faster than that of which can be seen the day I posted this comment: 198 people said 5 stars. 254 people said 1 star."

This game is terrible.  Does not work well on older IOS/Android devices -glitchy and slow.  I have an Iphone 4S and every time I go to the state map, it crashes.  The game is simple enough but not really strategic.  You are basically told what to upgrade.  But, if you are not part of one of the big alliances in the state, you are going to get crushed.  I have played for a few weeks and every time I get to a certain power, the reigning alliance destroys my base and takes all of my resources.  If you want to spend an arm and a leg, you might get competitive but the large alliances will still rally a ton of troops and crush you.  I finally spent some money to get close to my alliance and then got wiped out in the first day when they just kept hitting base after base.  Unless, you can play constantly, you will likely never build up your power."
confusion,Not Ready For Kindle AppStore,"Not Ready For Kindle AppStore. I've played Mobile Strike off both Google and Kindle. It can be a fun time waster provided the application is stable but the Kindle Fire version needs a LOT of work. Obviously, the game designers have put more effort into squeezing your wallet full of your hard earned cash than developing a stable platform. If you're not familiar with MS it's similar in design to Game of War. You construct your base from resources you build but they must be constructed in a proper order. Constructions use resources and cost time. If you plan to spend some time with this game then it's worthwhile to read some of the guides on the net. Those avid, take no prisoners players will quickly decimate your bases, drain your resources and execute your commander. These players, seemingly with unlimited disposable income, dominate most of the areas in the game. A player can literally rack up tens of thousands of dollars with bonus crates with speedup, boosts, extra resources, power options and other powerful items offerred at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT"" 😕. At one point your commander will be stuck at a particular level because you need to acquire 'commendations' which you have no choice but to purchase to get further in the game. This pay to play game is one of the worst I've seen in a long time! I'm shocked but not surprised that Arnold would endorse a game that takes advantage of their customers in this grossly unskilled combat game that you can only win by being the player that pays the most."

confusion,Crashes a lot. Good base and character building but very little else to play for,"Crashes a lot. Good base and character building but very little else to play for. I'm writing a revised review after 6-7 days of playing the game. I originally posted 4 stars, but knocking this down to 2.Starting with the positive, there are a few elements of the game which are quite enjoyable and some pretty in depth and have received some thought from the developers. The base building element is quite good and the ability to customize your character and bases strengths and weekends by electing where to invest your skills/research time or what modifications you make upon your gear is pretty good too. However, you soon realize that there is very little else to the game. Basically the battle / 'mission' elements to the game are just lacking. Missions are basically an endeviour of clicking a start button, waiting for somewhere between 2 minutes to 2 hours to elapse and then clicking a 'collect' button - I wish I could say it was more exciting but that's it. You can wage battles against your opponents however - sound more promising? Well, you basically pick a base to attack, send your troops in, and await for them to return to here the outcome. You do not see the battle, fight the battle, influence the battle or have any real sway over its outcome as far as I can see. So you spend all your time in the game bascially just increasing elements of your base from one level to the next. Furthermore, because all base items are chained dependencies upon each other, actually your base customization is really poor. You must upgrade your Wall to upgrade your HQ, and you must upgrade your Iron Mine (I think) to upgrade your wall and so on and so forth. The chose you have of what to build becomes simply a matter of 'how many' of each item you choose to build.Next on my hit list to highlight is the games undeniable drive to have you spend your money. My character is on level 19 and has a VIP level of 7 after quite a lot of hours played this week, but for the grand total of £3.99 you can start at level 50 which a VIP level of 30. Else, given the exponential increase in time it takes to build, train and research i imagine that would take about 1 month. If you don't want to spend you have a long waiting game ahead to be anywhere near those players who do. At every turn the game tries to pries you from this 3.99 investment with extra base items, unlocks for various things, huge amounts of gold etc. Its a bit too 'in your face' for my liking. I'm open minded to spending money on a game - but I first seek to see if its a game i'd like to play for some time - but alas if I spent money on this game, other than having a more powerful base I don't see what for - there's so little else to the game play that it just all feels a little pointless.The final point i'd draw attention to is the games reliability. This may not be the same for all - I guess it could be devise related but while sometimes I can play the game for over an hour, at other times the game might just exit every few minutes forcing a constant reload. It becomes really frustrating. I'm using an Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet for the record."

Contacted them several times, explaining the issue, their only response reinstall game ( have done this probably more times than I've played it now ) or check for updates which its been upto date everyday. Wouldn't be so bad but this app does require somesortof spending to fully appreciate the game and for those rare moments when it works, its a great game, its being let down by stability issues and poor customer / technical support.Honestly I'd avoid if I were you and try the same format just the medieval version Game of War.No stability issues there and better free bonuses."

On some of them, they never give you enough time. I played one at least 25 times and gave up and used the crystals to get more time. Then there is the fact you run out of energy. You either have to buy more or wait until it is restored. That is frustrating, especially if you're using a magic spell that has a time limit. I do wish that they had instructions somewhere to look at and read. There are parts that I do not understand. I will keep playing until I am bored. If they would put the instructions in it would help because I would know what my goal is. I have quit other games over no instructions. They make it impossible to write to them at these games usually. I dare you to get Kim Kardashian Hollywood to give you a real answer to a question or give back money lost. At least in this game, I had a mix up on a purchase of crystals and called Amazon, and got a refund right away. So it's my recommendation to try this game."

frustration,Good game but buggy,"Good game but buggy. As far as matching games go, this one is fairy decent. It adds the element of building a civilization along the way. Unfortunately, when using the Amazon Fire tablet, I encountered problems as the game progressed and the app itself would not always load. It was a bit frustrating having played so long only to have to uninstall it."

frustration,Frustrated,"Frustrated. 3 stars for creatvity .  But I am constantly frustrated because when I'm  trying to finish a collection and tap on a charger to do it, I often get sent to a game level where the icon flashes. If  I successfully complete it, I rarely win the icon I want.  Instead, Empire gives me a prize I already have. Sometimes. 10 or 15 of them.  Often just close game in frustration."
frustration,was fun,was fun. First off I was really into this game at first. It has a storline that went with the game to rebuild the town. It's a matching game that I enjoyed. The big problem for me was after I rebuilt the hut(I think it was) the game started to lag so bad I could barely play the game. Sorry but I had to uninstall the game. It was fun while it lasted.

But no worries I PAID for the coins, this time today, and many other times before today, May 23, 2016, I just get e-mails saying order is pending.  Of course it is NOT pending in my bank account, that money comes OUT IMMEDIATELY."

frustration,Causing sleeplessness??,"Causing sleeplessness??. I've been playing this game for about 9 months.  Thought it was fun so kept playing.  I refuse to pay actual money for the gems so reading the reviews inspired me to quit this game as the farther along you go, the more you'll need to pay actual money to continue.  But my biggest concern is my inability to shut down my brain when I go to bed.  I see the moves jumping around in my head and have a really hard time falling asleep.  I bought blue-light reducing glasses to help with this problem but didn't appear to help much.  So I decided to quit playing the game.  It's been about 2 weeks now that I haven't played the game, and I am finally able to fall asleep the way I used to prior to playing this game.  I'm wondering if it's all similar games and not just Cradle of Empires.  Anyone else having this problem?  My sleep is more important than playing a game so no more games for me.  I'm going to go to the library and loan out actual books instead."

frustration,Fun but can be tedious,"Fun but can be tedious. This is a fantastic game with a lot of levels. It's a match game with a story. It does take a long time to progress without spending money. While not terribly difficult, it does use the same set of matches repeatedly so if it's one you have gotten stuck on, it becomes tedious to beat it. That said, I have played this intermittently over a year while other similar games are now dust in the wind."
frustration,Watch out for touch screen mistakes!,"Watch out for touch screen mistakes!. I have played the PC predecessors of this game and am familiar with the various challenges/roadblocks than many people whine about. I'm at level 29 and have spent nothing. My complaint or caution is that sometimes my moves are misread and my choice is ignored ...moves on the far side of the screen occur that I didn't choose to make. This frequently causes a loss of the level I am playing. Game updates have improved but not eliminated the problem. When you are playing a timed level, this can REALLY be a source of anger and frustration!"

The cradle of empires game was easy enough to learn,but once the piggy bank was activated...against my choice,I could NOT get rid of it and keep the gems I had collected to use in the game without buying them back once I had already earned them.I hated this feature,so I deleted the game from my device to start over.so far,so good this time.still though,not the game I wanted,and if its on this game I couldn't find it.😕"

frustration,Different way of play match three,Different way of play match three. I like it. It's addicting and a different way to play match three games. Passes the time. Only thing I don't like is the energy. Having to wait so long for one energy. Change this and check might get a five star!
frustration,Entertaining and frustrating!,"Entertaining and frustrating!. Fun but feel it's not consistent.  Watch out for the experience points, wrong timing and you loose the points!"
frustration,Could Get Expensive,"Could Get Expensive. Love this game and am definitely addicted, but in order to get things you need to progress and to get to play for more than a few minutes before energy runs out, it can cost a fortune in no time.  I could literally play for hours if that wasn't the case.  I would rather pay $25 and buy the game than get nickled and dimed to death.  This is why I quit playing Candy Crush."

frustration,lives/energy goes down to fast,lives/energy goes down to fast. You have to buy energy or wait a long time to get it refiled. As l will not buy energy I can only play about 6 to 8 match 3 rounds per day.  Thus l can not rate the game higher even though l like it.
frustration,It no longer loads!,"It no longer loads!. I have played this for awhile and have had fun. Now, however, I can't get it to work. It just kicks me back to the app store or says I don't have an Amazon App store appwhen I clearly do. It's too frustrating to play now since I can't even play it!"

frustration,Could be better,"Could be better. Game itself is fun but it is obvious that the object of the game and the developers is to get you to spend money.  After advancing in the game and getting all my bonuses etc, I turned the game on to find that somehow all my progress was lost.  This happened 3 times so far.  Losing all that stuff and starting over again is frustrating.  Not to mention losing the stuff you paid for and can't get back."
frustration,Forget this game..fast,"Forget this game..fast. Forget this game!! Levels are ridiculous to try to reach.. boards are never given to advance . Putting level difference points of fifty of thousands, and only giving you a couple of hundred points when your permitted to beat a board.they say to follow villagers request for help, but make it impossible to beat the boards. .unless you buy something of course..I've played for a week, and have not been given the tiles to beat any board. Not one...if you want to beat your head on a wall, by all means, this game will do it. Uninstalling is the most enjoyment I've had out of this game.."
frustration,Frustrating,Frustrating. There seems to be no logic to how this game operates. Play endlessly to collect a charge and you are rewarded with everything but what you seek. Waste of time.
frustration,like it,like it. I like the game but just wish it didn't take so long to respond to touch.
frustration,Totally addictive and completely frustrating!,"Totally addictive and completely frustrating!. I have also been playing for over a year and I get so mad that you have to go through a level a million times before getting the items to complete collections. Somehow I still love the game. I think I persist because I just won't let it beat me and I really curious to see what's coming up next. Please, please fix this issue before it becomes a lost cause."
frustration,Patience equals success,"Patience equals success. As a puzzle game I do like Cradle of Empire however, it will take a while to accomplish most of your goals. Some of the collections seem to take forever to get because certain items are not only very hard to find but also some of the items you finally find may be needed for multiple collections and that can be very frustrating.  This game is certainly a challenge and will take you quite a long time to finish unless you are willing to spend actual money on in-game purchases to speed thing up."
frustration,It took long to get to the game boards to ...,It took long to get to the game boards to .... It took long to get to the game boards to play.  Too many how too instructions in between games.  I already stopped playing it.

frustration,Bad,Bad. It kept kicking me out don't download it
frustration,Ok,Ok. Energy restoration is too slow
frustration,BEWARE,BEWARE. This game has beautiful graphics and is fun to play in the BEGINNING.  Once you start getting up in levels the ONLY WAY TO SUCCEED IS TO PURCHACE TOKENS.  This game seems to be designed for failure.  For the BEGINNING levels I would give this game a 5.  To play this game for any long term play I would give it a 1 based on the fact you cannot succeed without purchasing tokens.
frustration,"Fun, but","Fun, but. This game is fun, but since I refuse to spend money it is slow going."
frustration,Needs improvement,"Needs improvement. I would give this 5 stars except for the fact that you can never seem to get the items you need especially in the higher levels and it's ridiculous how long it takes you to even get  to 100,000 in coins, food, etc.  Definitely needs some improvement in the players favor!"

I don't know why I haven't deleted this game already!! Is building the ship at least the end of the game?? Because I feel like I've been drowning in quicksand!!
frustration,Sounds are irritating,"Sounds are irritating. They keep adding the most annoying sounds and there is no in-app sound control to turn it down, just off for this game. I used to enjoy playing, but can hardly stand the noise now!"
frustration,Purchases Disappear,"Purchases Disappear. Although the game is fun, beware of this developer! First, I tried to purchase ""jewels"" in order to extend my play and ended up spending over $ 20 because the purchases were never confirmed so I believed they didn't go through.  That left me with 350 jewels to play. When I stopped the game, I had over 300 left.  The next day, that number was 15. I thought I was mistaken about the number so  I purchased a ""package"" that included at least 60 jewels before I shut the game down thinking I would play today.  When I opened the game, there were only 5 jewels remaining and that's because of the daily ""bonus"" of 5 jewels.  This game is a money trap.  I have learned my lesson and will not download any other games from this developer!!"
frustration,Fun!! But takes forever to accomplish much.,Fun!! But takes forever to accomplish much.. The collection items are so randomly given it is beyond ridiculous.  Been sitting on a few quest's for weeks! I play daily and then some!
frustration,Difficult,"Difficult. Interesting, plenty of add on activities to prevent boredom.  However, it's unbeatable without an endless supply of crystals."
frustration,Doesn't work,"Doesn't work. Showed a gear icon that appeared to be settings that would allow turning off or at least lowering the volume on the nauseating music, but seemed to be locked into a tutorial mode because nothing happened when the icon was clicked.

frustration,Must pay to move forward :(,Must pay to move forward :(. Must pay to move forward :(
frustration,Waste of Money,"Waste of Money. I love playing the game but when I purchase crystals this company never sends me the items that I purchase in a timely manner. I purchase items to help win the level that I'm on. I have to contact support via email, which can take days for a response. I am basically wasting money playing this game due to I can never get the items I purchased sent to me IMMEDIATELY  ""while on the level I'm needing it on, without sending a screenshot to customer service. TIME TO DELETE THIS GAME!!!"
frustration,😐,😐. frustrating that it started me all over again when I got a new tablet. Now I can't make any progress. I especially can't ever win a game when I get the infinity symbol. At this rate It is becoming boring and I will never get back to my previous level.
frustration,I am not happy with this issue.,"I am not happy with this issue.. As of today 8/8/2018, I am still having problems with this app. I have contacted same about this and have received nothing. I just purchased a starter pack from Amazon for this game. I played a few games this morning, went to another screen and now I can't get into the app. This is the only app this is happening to. I go to the icon and click, it brings up same cover page for a few seconds and then goes black. I have lost all my activity and gems and lives for this game."
frustration,"Too hard, not fun","Too hard, not fun. You've made this way too hard and expensive, so it is no longer fun. Plus a bunch of evil players have come and made it impossible to place in the cat treat game, unless you are rich."
frustration,fun but frustating,"fun but frustating. I very much enjoy this game because I have been able to learn while playing, it is challenging, the graphics are beautiful.  HOWEVER, it is also extremely frustating.  I have 2 collections I cannot complete and have been trying for almost three weeks to get the missing chargers.  Even when I manage to complete a challenging level, I get a couple of energy points, nothing substantial.  Seriously annoying.  Oh, and by the way, if you are giving energy points as prizes, considering how quickly energy is used up (as noted in numerous comments here) you could at least make it a larger number.  I also find it very annoying that when I am stuck and unable to clear any of the current quests, no more are made available.  In one of my other games, quests are added regularly, allowing me to go to something new and come back to the older quests.  This would help eliminate the frustration of trying the same game over and over again.  As I have a limited income, I am not free to spend money on crystals which makes it extremely difficult to make any progress.  I will continue playing as I do enjoy the game and the challenges, but I don't know how much longer, due to the high frustration level"
frustration,Okay Game,"Okay Game. Fun game, but hate that everything requires either a payment or time."
frustration,Am I doing something wrong?,"Am I doing something wrong?. SO SLOW...I tried deleting & reinstalling. Graphics & story line enticed me, but it is too slow to respond."
frustration,slow to much story,slow to much story. to much back and forth story line really would like to just play the game without all the story
frustration,Slowwwww progress through the game,Slowwwww progress through the game. The game is too slow moving. I like to work toward goals but this is too frustrating.  You can only play about 6 times (win or lose) before lives are gone.  I can't seem to play for long before I have to leave it and wait to play again.
frustration,Slow To Advance,"Slow To Advance. I like the game, however, if you're looking for a game to play for a few hours at a time, this is not for you. Energy goes fast and the time it takes to recharge is looooong! Player uses up their energy each time they play regardless if you complete or lose the level. So unless you want to spend real money to purchase the green gems to replenish your energy, I would not advise dowloading!"
frustration,Enjoyable but Frustrating,"Enjoyable but Frustrating. I really like this match 3 game, but I find it frustrating in that you just get to playing and you run out of energy to proceed forward unless you either wait until time fills up the energy meter or you give up and buy, with your money, more resources with which to continue the game! The puzzles are fun and evolve in complexity and new challenges as the game progresses. It is a well constructed game."
frustration,Tried it,Tried it. Just started game and found I was constantly tapping something just to get back to the matching game. Then found I ran out of the number of moves. How? Nothing told me what my goal was for that particular screen such as needed to collect 30 apples and 15 purple flowers. Have played enough games that pulled me in and ended up paying real money. This won't be another one. I am deleting it.
frustration,Not the most engaging game.,"Not the most engaging game.. First, it's not much fun playing the same level dozens of times and never getting the quest item.  Second, I hate timed games.  And third, if the game says a charger item is on a level, it should be there.  Not one to three other unneeded items.  I'll probably uninstall the game soon."

frustration,Great game but has some errors,"Great game but has some errors. I am so addicted to these story's but there are some problems with it, starting off i always get an error message which really drives me crazy. Also, everything costs so much money. How my biggest problem is that I read about 11 stories already, and it was fine, but about 5 or them only have me 1 gem of or 10, but it never gave them to me.

frustration,Less gem choices,Less gem choices. It's ok. But they need to have less gem choices and I also hate when they doubt the choice you made even though you don't have enough gems or none at all. Like you have to pay. So what would make it better is less gem choices.

frustration,"Keep your money, but make some friends","Keep your money, but make some friends. Like everyone has already put, money is a huge deal. There is no give if you can't spend money on it. You need to keep up with the gear, VIP level, commander level or you will not survive unless you plan on shielding and not doing what the game is meant for which makes it boring. They need parameters for base levels so some one who has put $1000 in can't hit someone who hasn't put a dime in it. And yes it can cost more then that to keep up. Can meet good people on the game and establish friendships for boring days. Two stars for conversation, 1 star for graphics, 0 for playability if you are on a strict money budget."

frustration,"Terrible company, often you will not get what is advertised with in-app purchases, one email per day per issue","Terrible company, often you will not get what is advertised with in-app purchases, one email per day per issue. I wish we could give negative stars. Frustrating frustrating frustrating, did I mention frustrating, zero customer service.Pros:Could be fun if it worked right and you got your money 's worthCons:1. The game never works right. Also if you think you are playing for free, forget about it, this game is not fun at all unless you spend money, otherwise you are constantly losing battles. Been there tried that, not fun at all.2. 80% of the time you don't get what you paid for. Example, you buy a pack that is $99 and comes with few different types of of upgrade, lets call them A, B and C. So you paid $99 to get upgrade A, upgrade B, Upgrade C. Fantastic you are all happy now to use the upgrade and make your moves, 1 problem, for some reason when you go to apply upgrade C, you get an error. Ok contact customer service right? Read #33. Contacting customer service = you send an email for help, you immediately get a programed response saying their team is viewing your claim, then you wait 24 to 48 hours for response. When they do respond it is always the same:A. If your issues is the game giving you an error or something not working right, then you are told ""programmers are aware and are working on it. (sure, I have been waiting for over a year for the programmers to fix my errors and nothing, meanwhile they have my money for the issue that is not working)B. If your issue is you didn't get the correct amount of something then they will keep incorrectly telling you that you are the one that is mistaken and you did get the correct amount,  even tho after the first 3 times you have learned your lesson and this time you have screen shots as proof.(see my first picture about credits, at the bottom you see link for 6 screnshots as proof, still didn't get my 3 million  credits till this day, now it is obsolete)4. One email per day. After waiting 24 to 48 hours (mostly 48 or longer) you get a response back from  customer service if you are lucky, and you respond, you now have to wait 24 hours for a response, in short your communication is limited to one email per day making every issue a week long project.5. Don't expect them to read your emails, example last week I like an idiot decided to come back to this game, paid for upgrade pack, part of it was something called ""instant multiple research"". What this does is allows you to upgrade bunch of categories with one click instead of literally 100s of clicks. Emailed customer service complaining about ""instant multiple research"" not working, 2 days later got a response saying we understand you have an issue with ""alliance gifts"" we are working on it. Now ""alliance gifts"" have nothing to do with ""instant multiple research"" so obviously they didn't read my email at all.That is like you call AT&T to complain about your ""cellphone service"" and they say: we understand you are having an issue with your"" tivo box"" and we are working on it.That was last week, replied to them saying their response had nothing to do with my issue, you want to know what their response is?I will let you know when they respond because 7 days and 5 emails later, I have 0 response to report to you. This is Machine Zone's idea of customer service.6. No way to contact this company other than the process above, which basically means no way of contacting this company. Mobile Strike, gods of War and a couple of other games are owned by machine zone.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME / COMPANY, THEIR FINE PRINT SAYS YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HAVE THE GAME WORKING PROPERLY OR OWE YOU ANYTHING AT ALL WHETHER ITS THE GAME WORKING  CORRECTLY, YOU GETTING WHAT YOU PAID FOR IN-APP PURCHASES. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION MEANS ZERO TO THIS COMPANY, I WARNED YOU.LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS HERE AND EVERY PLACE ELSE, ALSO GOOGLE ""MOBILE STRIKE COMPLAINT""."

You can't teleport your base without spending real money so I uninstalled after the third time this jerk raided my base. Don't waste your time with this game.

Mobile Strike could be a fun and addicting game, if the developers had placed game play ahead of profiteering.  Before you can get emotionally hooked into the ""story line"" (if there is one), and real action, you are confronted too soon with having to make purchases.  You can decide to play the game for 30 seconds per day, which does not build game loyalty or desire to come back and play, or you can spend money.It really becomes a choice. Which games will you choose to invest in.  I did not choose this one.  I have my games that I invest in. this one does not give me reason to switch.Will it give you enough reason?  I don't know.  I don't think the developers give you enough time to figure that out."

When I first got this app I completely loved now its absolutely annoying every time I go in it says it needs an update it will not allow me to access anything unless I update itwhen I go to the app store to update it it doesn't show that there is an update available so now I have absolutely no access to my recipes and I can't add anything please fix it

frustration,Updated Warning,"Updated Warning. Do not review this game until you get to at least level 15.  While the graphics are undisputedly good, you will never get to the end of the game unless you are wealthy and have the reflexes of a teenager.  As you rise in levels it takes more and more time to finish even one puzzle.  The pieces you need for a set of items never seem to show up.  The blitz mode is almost impossible and there is no way around it.  Every once and awhile they have some little side game that will just eat up all your ""energy"" and bonuses.  I finally just started to ignore them.  And finally everything costs.  This game can eat up money faster than Candy Crush.  I have played it everyday for months and have spent more money than I ever have on a game.  I am about to delete it.  BEWARE"

I would love this game if it didn't take months of playing the same puzzle multiple times a day until out of energy each time and still never getting that quest piece let alone any of those other little things needed to complete a collection to progress the game.  I would love to love this game but all it does is make me bored or frustrated.  I've completed the puzzle at least 200 times now.  Why no quest piece??????2021 update:  After not playing for a while I decided to pick it up again.  There is nothing to do past level 16 besides play the same boring frustrating puzzles over and over.  I need 8000 to get to the next level and each puzzle is 100 exp.  In other words its going to take forever to even progress.  That is the only way to progress by the way because you simply cannot get any of the ""rare"" items that complete a construction.  I have played so many times for just one item and it never shows up.  Not once after years of playing.  The only way to progress is to buy the item with real money and its not like its a dollar.  More like $20."

frustration,Fun treasure hunt game,"Fun treasure hunt game. Fun game with cool graphics and quests. Only two complaints: sometimes when trying to find a required item you can complete the level it's supposed to be on a dozen times in a row and still not find it, which moves the game from challenging and fun to frustrating and no fun. Also, I hate hate hate faded mode, where the colors are faded from the pieces. My eyes aren't as good as they used to be and it's really hard to differentiate the pieces by shape alone.Otherwise, a really fun game."

It always has the loading circle spinning and nothing happens. Not sure if you can save your data and reload game on new device. Most other facebook connected games let you do this automatically. I already had to start over once because of tablet death. I probably would spend some money on this game if transferable data to a new device was an option.

I liked some of the other games by Phyton,  The problem I have with this game, is it's slow to respond to taps, too much lag time after you tap. Then you tap again, and you miss things and the next job has popped up,,it gets frustrating, because it doesn't allow me to look things over to see what objects do, or to get info.. I'll give it a little more time, it might improve as I go, as it could just be I'm doing something wrong."

distrust,Some annoying issues,"Some annoying issues. Here are some bad things about this game:1.  The amount of energy to play the puzzles is too high.  I can go thru 100 energy in less than 30 min. easily.  Then wait for hours for it to build up again only to play 3 or 4 puzzles before it runs out again. COME ON MAN!2.  Why is it SOOOO SOOOO hard for the appropriate items or chargers needed for quests to drop?  Example, During the Chocolate Day Event, after spending over 500 energy (over  2 days worth of playing) I only had 1 recipe finished.  COME ON MAN!3. Having played the game for almost a month and getting over 525 collection items and over 200 chargers (yes I counted them all), I only have 19 collections finished.  That's not even 20.  I've wasted a whole lot of TIME and ENERGY only receive items and some chargers that I DO NOT need.  COME ON MAN!I don't know if y'all designed the game this way, but it needs to change.Here are some suggestions:1.  Reduce the energy cost on the puzzles or increase energy regeneration so that players can play for a little bit longer.2. Please make it easier for quest items and chargers to drop.  Those Magic and Lucky Charm spells (at least for me) didn't help me at all.3. The events have to last a little bit longer.  There needs to be a better chance of getting the reward.4. Increase the time on some of these timed puzzles.  Some of these puzzles are very difficult, having to do them in under a minute and a half is just insane.I like this style of match-3, clear the tiles type of play.  It's a challenging game, that is why I give it this rating."
distrust,Frustrating instead of entertaining,"Frustrating instead of entertaining. Have to play the same puzzles over and over again in search of items you never get to make collections.  Can quickly become a money pit of you allow it, so beware.  It becomes boring to listen to the same old music and do the same level and never complete collections and tasks.  Done with it."

If you have some money laying around, It's definitely set up to buy your way through it. The daily rewards are crap, need to make it worth coming back. When I play a level for a cat, I want a cat, not a friggin bone (players know what I mean). The occasional app resets are stupid. I've never played a game that resets in the middle of play. I've lost some valuable pieces because of this. Hmm, maybe that's part of the plan...  Anyhow, I started out with 4 stars and ended with 1."

distrust,Hard to Find Items,Hard to Find Items. It's a good game and you can tell the did developers put in a lot of effort. My biggest complaint is you'll play a level to complete a task and you won't find the item you need. If you play this game just be aware that you'll play the same level over and over and over and over and over again. And it's obnoxious especially because they only give you extremely limited energy to play the levels in the first place. It's annoying enough that I'm considering maybe deleting the game.

distrust,I will always move on before I pay a recurring fee to play a game.,"I will always move on before I pay a recurring fee to play a game.. Not a bad match three game upfront, but the game becomes increasingly unfriendly as you progress.  As you build the different parts of the town (farm, pottery, etc.), you can't upgrade them until you reach a certain level.  So now I have completed all the available boards - Hut, Farm, Sepat and Pottery, and am halfway through level 18.  I can't level up until I reach level 20 for Pottery, 22 for Hut, 25 for Sepat and 26 for Farm.My only choices for progress are to replay completed levels for days or (I assume) spend jewels.  Add me to the list of customers who would much rather pay an upfront fee, or a purchase fee once I learn the game, rather than have companies try to nickel and dime me.FACE IT, DEVELOPERS!  I have numerous options to play other games and will continue to delete these types of stacked games and move on to something new.  The only way you will get any money from me is to change the way you bill for playing.  A one time fee is the only way you will ever see my money.People, if you want a fun Match 3 game that can be played indefinitely without spending a dime, get Gummy Drop.  It can be done!"

Sometimes it's just an adjacent piece, but the location of the selection seems random and completely independent of where I actually touched the screen.Also, there's never enough energy, but the fact I want to keep playing after I've run out must mean I like it."

distrust,Great game but...,Great game but.... Nice game so far but getting the materials to finish is very difficult. You are forced to buy crystals because you do not get it playing the game. Does not matter how I play I do not get the materials. This is going to make me delete the game.
distrust,Meh.,"Meh.. Typical match 3 game with a storyline that includes side games and contests. Extra game enhancers and add-ons cost major bucks and the game goes very slowly without them.  I refuse to buy these power ups and ""magic spells"", so I've hit a plateau and have been at middle levels for months.  This app is also huge, eats a lot of memory and slows down my Kindle Fire.  I'm pretty frustrated and will be uninstalling this app after a year of playing this game."
distrust,Similar to others,"Similar to others. I enjoy this type of game, it combines match 3 with world building. Unfortunately, at the beginning of the game you spend a lot of time in just two locations."
distrust,fun game,fun game. I love the game but do not like the in game purchase prompts. If this continues I will delete game soon.
distrust,annoying,annoying. I am frustrated with this game. It keeps popping up when I do web searches. I accepted but the pop ups continued so I removed it. Please solve this problem...annoying
distrust,Not for Kindle!,"Not for Kindle!. I downloaded this game for my Kindle Fire and was really enjoying playing it. Then they updated it with all this Halloween stuff and my game experience went into the toilet!  Every time I try to play it crashes. If I can manage to start a match three when I win it crashes and I have lost not only my energy but my winnings as well. The first round of  Halloween ended and my game returned to normal. Then I opened the ship. It now crashes the game as well only not as often. Then the new round of Halloween started and I can no longer play at all. Every time the halloween quest graphic comes up and I try to X out of it the game crashes. So if you are on Kindle, DO NOT BOTHER. I need to be able to turn of auto updates and delete the ones that are already on there without losing my proress"

distrust,It's no good if it doesn't work.,"It's no good if it doesn't work.. The app doesn't work!  I have deleted, then reinstalled it twice.  It still looks like it would be fun, and perhaps it is, but not on my Kindle Fire."
distrust,Frustrated...,Frustrated.... I really enjoy playing this game but the problem that I encountered was I needed to update it and it wouldn't allow it it kept failing and I had to uninstall and reinstall and start over at the very very beginning and that really sucked! There should be away to keep your progress when it's connected to Facebook.
distrust,I just hate that you can only play for so long before ...,I just hate that you can only play for so long before .... I am addicted to this game. I just hate that you can only play for so long before you run out of energy and you either have to stop playing or by some more.

distrust,Fun game but can't use settings,Fun game but can't use settings. I  love the game but I can't click on the settings icon. I'm stuck having to click on the next task. I would like to remove the music on the game but I can't.
distrust,Four Stars,Four Stars. Slow loading game.
distrust,"Challenging yes, cheats you every time!","Challenging yes, cheats you every time!. I found the game quite challenging and fun at times, yet annoying and a bit of a cheat. Trying to gain specific artifacts and items is almost impossible. You can use all of energy, pass and complete levels, and the item you are playing for is barely if ever rewarded! I became frustrated while I was playing the ""Portal game"" I realized the presents were sealing themselves back closed as I had nearly opened them...that's a cheat in my book! I deleted the game!"
distrust,Boring and slow,"Boring and slow. The game looked interesting, so I tried it. I am simply bored with games with a plot line that takes forever to work out. Yes, a considerable amount of time is spent in the early rounds explaining how things work. but most of the explanations don't make sense and the acts are more or less intuitive. I also dislike games that require a cash investment in order to continue. When I ran out of energy, I deleted the game."

distrust,"Too slow, boring story, can't just play game without story","Too slow, boring story, can't just play game without story. Uuggghh, I just wanted to play the match-3 game without having to read the story. It's a dumb, very slow moving story. Uninstalled."
distrust,"Lots of fun, but gets bogged down..","Lots of fun, but gets bogged down... I do love this game and play it daily.  My complaint would be how slow it can be to finish quests or find chargers for the collections. When games go too slowly, despite winning all of the puzzle games, I get bored and stop playing."
distrust,Iffy,Iffy. Challenging but repetitive.  Matching difference levels depending on the place in your game.
distrust,to hard to follow and play it. It used ...,to hard to follow and play it. It used .... to hard to follow and play it. It used up to many coins or time to play 1 game so you would run out quickly. I deleted this game.

distrust,Challenging and Unique - WHOOPS!  NOT SO FAST.  EDITED AND AMENDED REVIEW.,"Challenging and Unique - WHOOPS!  NOT SO FAST.  EDITED AND AMENDED REVIEW.. WARNING ABOUT GAME UPDATE:  So, after my review earlier today, I updated my game from the app store.  Immediately it became impossible to play the game.  It kept freezing and freezing and freezing.  You shouldn't UPDATE the game.  Apparently updating will screw up the game play.I tried everything to fix the problem.  I closed and opened the game.  I powered off the Kindle and restarted it.  Finally, I stupidly uninstalled and reinstalled the game.  This works with Panda Pop, because the info shares from Facebook.  But, I should have known, that didn't work for this game.  I ended up at the beginning again, losing all progress.I AM UNINSTALLING THE GAME.  I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY GAMES THAT ARE GLITCHED.  And, I take back my earlier statement, ""This game is lots of fun with many challenging levels and a unique back story.  If people like match three games with a twist, this is the game for them.""  The game IS fun, and I like a challenge, but I don't want to have to deal with customer service people every time I update a game.  So, be aware that updates may screw you up.  Good luck to all you other players, but I'm out of here."
distrust,GETTING OLD,"GETTING OLD. I was fascinated with this game, I couldn't stop playing.  Well now it seems you have to play the same game over and over and over just to get a trinket that you hardly get so you can move on to build the town.  Life is too short to be mesmerized in a game that wants to suck you in to spend money.  I think I will take a walk!"
distrust,Difficult to figure out,Difficult to figure out. Very difficult to transition from one level to the next. Definitely not one of my favorites.
distrust,On the fence about this one,"On the fence about this one. Like the concept; however, the energy levels are way too low and way way too s!ow to regen.  After running out of energy in about 15 mins. I just go to my other games and wait until the next day. I would think admins. would want players to stay on their game longer but who knows. Also I don't find where you can save your game.  When I had go get a new Kindle had to completely start over and lost all progress😵. Almost didn't pick it up again and still don't really care about it like I did because it will take forever to get back to where I was before.  And yes I did try to connect through Facebook but to no avail."
distrust,Two Stars,Two Stars. To hard thinking of deleting it
distrust,Not bad for free game,Not bad for free game. Ok game. Puzzles do get harder. Frustrating it takes a long time to complete collections.
distrust,Boring and inane,"Boring and inane. This kept coming up as an ad while playing spider solitaire. Thought it might be interesting, wrong! It spends so much time doing inane thinvs on the screen, and without telling you why, that you quickly get tired of plsying along and not actually playing."
distrust,fun but frustrating,fun but frustrating. Levels load very slowly.
distrust,don't make me pay,"don't make me pay. Why can't you get a game that doesn't make you pay for lives? Fun game but I have to set it down to regenerate live or power. I'm NOT buying stuff but I WOULD buy the game,"
distrust,if ur bored,"if ur bored. This is a cute game. It's like they put a couple of games that are similar to very popular games like candy crush and a popular game that u complete quests(idk a name off hand) together into one. So if ur bored this can waste a lot of time, until u run out of energy. I very much dislike games that have the energy thing. I will play them for a few days until it gets to where I can't play it but for a few minutes because my energy is gone. I then I delete it. So that's why I gave 3 stars. Get rid of that ridiculous energy stuff so we can play for however long we want, please! Then u will get 5 stars."
distrust,Cat lady,Cat lady. Fun game but takes too long to earn gems and tends to freeze.
distrust,Good game,"Good game. Really enjoy the game, the only thing that  is a problem to me is that it will stop and close out where you have to reopen the game."
distrust,Great game but....,Great game but..... It's a great game but I hate that you have to play the same level 10+ times just to get the item you were after. I know ii played one level 20 (give or take a few) times trying to get a comb. I kept getting everything but the comb. That's the only drawback.
distrust,One Star,One Star. Game moved too slow
distrust,Weary,"Weary. I am so weary of downloading games that after playing one or two times you have to spend money to continue. NO MORE, I uninstall and will always give them a poor review."
distrust,Two Stars,Two Stars. Game continually freezes
distrust,Hate the Way You Cannot Move at Times,"Hate the Way You Cannot Move at Times. Too often, I waste time trying to make my next move.  This is especially ridiculous on timed games.  First, I have to wait to move, and that includes even when I attempt your selection.  Then, when I can finally select a square, the game moves it where it wants, not allowing me to make a move.  You can make suggestions, but they shouldn't keep me from moving and you should NEVER, EVER override my  choices!  This has stopped me from progressing as I see no way to handle timed mode as you  control the board.  I am playing the Kindle version.  Other version s may be more honest."
distrust,I just want to connect three or four icons and be done with it - like Candy Crush,"I just want to connect three or four icons and be done with it - like Candy Crush. too complicated.  I don't want to ""build"" and empire.  I just want to connect three or four icons and be done with it - like Candy Crush."
distrust,fun but...,fun but.... Keeps freezing up and it is NOT because it is -9 outside. Upsetting. Other re Jews talk about how much the game cost (hidden or otherwise) but I can't get that far.

distrust,Fun but frustrating,"Fun but frustrating. Generally a fun game.  However, there is the level where the grass overtakes you at the same time you have to get rid of the totem pole.  This level is impossible to beat, and just makes me angry."

distrust,Crashes,Crashes. It seems to be a fun game but it keeps crashing. Every time I start a new &#34;assignment&#34; it crashes before loading the new one or while loading the new puzzle. Very frustrating!

At this point I am finding the game to be a bit tedious.  I like the playing screens but don't care for the interaction in between with the game's characters.  I don't want to have to read and prefer to simply advance to the next level and keep playing.
distrust,looping problem,looping problem. I was enjoying the game and had reached the pottery second level on level 12 as I started playing the 1st game after finishing the level it would kick me out of game to main screen. After 20 tries I gave up and reloaded since it always went back to previous game played. Now I. Have to start all over. The game is fun but a little slow between screen changes
distrust,like except,like except. I really like this a place except when I have to play something because I accidentally touch something with my finger or thumb. That's rather frustrating

disgust,"fun, but slow","fun, but slow. I enjoy match three and building games. This is a good one. But has a very annoying lag in everything from opening levels to moving gems. Very annoying. Otherwise fun game."
disgust,"Too Slow, not free","Too Slow, not free. Did not like the game at all, too slow. Had to push numerous times before you would see a play happen.  Of course you can buy coins to speed it up. What is it about the word free that an app developer doesn't understand? I uninstalled it within minutes of installing."
disgust,Its an alright match 3 Game.,"Its an alright match 3 Game.. Its fun, a little slow, good graphics, confusing storyline, you have to wait forever on energy."
disgust,Ok,Ok. Fun game but frustrating when you complete a task but don't receive reward?! Ask to play for one reward but even with multiple completions still can't get reward!
disgust,It's an okay game,"It's an okay game. Positives - it's easy to get energy to play a few rounds at a time. Not bad loading time. Once you learn the game, pretty easy to follow along.Negatives - I've never had another game where you can finish with over 20 moves left and it not be a three star completion.  That leads me to believe that even though it shows a point system for the stars, it's really set that you have to play each board a set number of times. I tested it by purposefully doing bad on levels, and it was still the same number of times played to get the three star ranking. Also, the board layout can be confusing, as you start at number 1 (expected), but not everything is labeled, and it doesn't follow any order.Overall, an okay game if you want something different."
disgust,o.k.,o.k.. Using rating system on tablet is rough.
disgust,had fun playing until I got to roughly level 14 then ...,"had fun playing until I got to roughly level 14 then .... I downloaded the game , everything went well, had fun playing until I got to roughly level 14 then the game crashed every time I was ahead.  Python Ltd. Customer Service was of absolutely no help basically telling me that it was the fault of my Kindle Fire  and I had to reboot every time the game crashed loosing all the items gained.  Would I recommend this game to anyone, NO.  It needs to be pulled and the entire program logic double checked for bugs and bad sectors."

disgust,Fun...until...,"Fun...until.... I love the game. Don't get me wrong. But, for almost a week today, every time I have tried to log into the game...keeps crashing, Continuously...Impossible. Fix it, please. It's a shame because it is one of my favorite game ever."
disgust,In game apps.,"In game apps.. Even though game is free, you don’t get very far w/o having to buy moves or you have to start over.  Very annoying. I suppose after a person gets better this wouldn’t be the case but until then, get your wallet out.  Maybe I don’t understand the game yet either."
frustration,Three Stars,Three Stars. Game is slow and always stating I over.

frustration,Intrigueing but technically flawed,"Intrigueing but technically flawed. I really wanted to like this game--it has a unique combination of match 3 and strategy.  However, the game kept crashing, usually with 5 minutes of the start.  Whatever task you were in the middle of would be lost."
frustration,game,game. Too slowNot enough energy to play the game for any length of time.
frustration,"So far, so-so","So far, so-so. Decent graphics, and so far, Lvl 10, no timed boards. I play to relax, and I hate timed boards. Negative note, there is already a task FORCING me to buy game tokens with real money. NO. This was advertised as a FREE game. I will no be spending money on the game and will delete if these things continue. Also, the game is slow to replace energy, though I don't understand why there is an energy requirement anyway. Shouldn't the devs WANT people to get hooked and play long sessions. Again, if this becomes too annoying, I will delete."
frustration,Please fix,"Please fix. I've been playing for a couple of months and was having fun, but within the last 2 weeks, the game will not load. Very frustrating."
frustration,UNFAIR,"UNFAIR. This is a fun game and the graphics are great, but don't expect to earn things fairly through play.  You are set up to fail unless you purchase items to complete collections. I've been playing daily for months, yet I still have 18 incomplete collections that have been sitting for months due to my inability to find the missing items needed to complete. Why??? Like I said,  I play daily. No reason for that. Additionally, the ""add friends"" feature doesn't work. With other games, you can trade items with friends to complete collections, give gifts, etc. The same features is said to be available in this game but it's inconveniently unavailable so you will be incented to purchase items instead of earning them fairly through play.  Since I've stuck around so long, clearly I'm a little addicted, but it's time to delete this app."
frustration,One Star,"One Star. slow, slow, slow"
frustration,My favorite game,"My favorite game. I really enjoy playing the game but some things are too hard to find. I believe the lives should restore faster. Amazon needs to hurry and update the game also. I can't do half the things I need to do now. I just hope this comment will speed up the process on upgrading the app itself. I really don't have much else to say about the app but it has to be a certain length to submit which I think is very dumb. How long do you really think a comment on a review should be, nobody is going to want a whole paragraph about a game honestly."

frustration,fun,fun. The game is a little slow
frustration,Frustrating,"Frustrating. Decent graphics though on the small side. However, the screen can be expanded. I found the game ultimately frustrating early on. You're not given enough energy points to play for very long and it takes forever for the game to award you with the items you're trying to collect. I started out enjoying the game but ended up deleted it."
frustration,Please skip the fluff,"Please skip the fluff. I like match three games but do not like the ""story"" and fluff that come with some of them.  I just want to play the game itself."

I give up and try Another level with an even 20 taps, finish the level then tap .. well, you get the idea. I deleted the game only to find out that I can't review the game unless it's loaded. So I reload, try the game again. What a disaster."
frustration,Not impressed,"Not impressed. I just bought a new Kindle and thought I'd try a new game. While the Kindle doesn't have any problems with other games, it is very slow with this game.

frustration,NOT ENOUGH MATCH PLAY,"NOT ENOUGH MATCH PLAY. Although this is a match 3 game, it takes a lot of clicks to get to the ""game"".  The basic screen is too busy  - just too much going on to worry with.  I would prefer a lot less of that and more game play."

Skype initially denied the existence of such an app. Finally, it acknowledged that it did not work properly.PayPal said my payment covered a service and not refundable. Skype ignored repeated request using email (no phone for a telephony provider?)Just today, pursuing use for my Kindle Fire, I found that my initial deposit was forfeit for inactivity. I used chat to request reinstatement. The representative seemed unable to extract information despite a ""Dick & Jane"" narrative, asking off-base questions and even, well into the conversation, requesting my screen name -- provided on the transcript. It became apparent that, if not illiterate, the representative was trained to deflect callers and outlast any caller's attempt at redress."

frustration,Very glitchy.,"Very glitchy.. I'm sorry I'm having to post this to you, but I want to get this off my chest, this Skype is the worst one I'm using, it is so glitchy, calls would last for 1 second, a lot of messages would appear in random places I'm not sure what's going on, my friend is also having a lot of problems with your app too where when she makes a call it starts flashing black on her phone she's even told me that you haven't responded to her messages. ( btw Skype calls wouldn't last a second for me I forgot to put it there, but for some reason I can't go back to fix it. ) I think you guys might need to fix these problems on your app. I'm not saying your app isn't all that bad because I get to make more groups and do a bit more stuff than others, and I do think this app will have a lot of potential there's just a lot of stuff that needs to be fixed badly. I still do use it, but its the only thing I can use for right now."

My cell phone just broke so I thought I would get a skype number and a subscriotion and just use my tablet as my phone for a while.  Hasn't imported all of my contacts from my phone, particularly the newest ones from the last month which is most frustrating because ose are my co workers. Also, when someone calls me there is no ringing, no notification at all. When I open the app it just says missed call. And finally, the app will not let me send text messages. It says - you don't have Skype credit, buy credit or a subscription.  I HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION!!!!"
frustration,Not Greay,Not Greay. At the moment when I'm in a call i can't open another app which isn't helpful because that's the only reason I call is because we are in a game. And I have to constantly leave and close the app just so I can see the messages. It's a real struggle.

frustration,Mobile app became unusable after recent update,"Mobile app became unusable after recent update. Last week my mobile Skype decided to update on its own without even asking my permission to do so as any other app would do. Update brought back bunch of garbage from 2 years of prior communications, including all of the blocked and deleted people and bots! To make the matter worse - the is no option to delete the from the screen either.And now the most important issue that mames this Skype update totally worthless - you CAN NOT see which of your contacts is online. The green light feature is gone, it doesn't appear even on Skype echo which is always online. They need to fix that bug,obviously. It is a bug, because yesterday i did see that green light at some point, and after i closed the app and opened it again - it was blind as usual.Please fix it!"
frustration,ENDLESS  CRASHES,"ENDLESS  CRASHES.

frustration,Update Almost Ruined the Skype OMG,"Update Almost Ruined the Skype OMG. Ugh. The updated Skype is almost horrible. I face too many glitches. One,the volume is too high. Even if Shogunyan mutes my Kindle, I can still hear Richard loudly. Two, Skype continuously crashes for no apparent reason. One minure (I meant to say minute) Skype works and then the next it pops up with a message that says, &#34; Skype is not responding,would you like to close it?&#34; If you say yes it closes the app and you have to reboot. If not, the message keeps popping up. Try to get to the old Skype app? NO, DOESN'T WORK, IT'S NOT IN THE APPSTORE ANYMORE. THEY SHOULD FIX ALL GLITCHES BEFORE PUTTING IT IN THE APPSTORE AGAIN. Oh my god. It's no fair!!!!!!!!!!! Gosh Skype people, you gotta fix the glitches!!!!!😤"
frustration,Frustrating to work with.,"Frustrating to work with.. There's a lot of instances where the notifications tell me I receive a message from a friend, and then when I go to check it, it vanishes. So apparently, Skype 's notifications get the message, but the app doesnt even bother to log what was said, and even when your friend is logged in, it won't show you what was said. You can't even access the history either, which is just overall frustrating. Terrible app to compliment a service that should be better than this."
frustration,"Love the app, hate the update","Love the app, hate the update. I love Skype, so I can keep in touch with family and friends. It is free and easy to use (even my grandma has one). The quality was mediocre, but not bad.But since the update, I haven't been able to talk to anyone. It's continually crashing and causing my entire kindle to run slowly. It's been days and I'm very, very frustrated. It's probably going to be uninstalled until Skype can figure it out. Taking away the update would help."
frustration,Current version does not work.,"Current version does not work.. 5.0.0.54266 on Kindle Fire HD does not work.  If you make a voice call, the other person can pick up and you can talk to them - however, the UI itself is still stuck on the ""connecting"" screen.. If you click/touch the screen and/or attempt to change the volume - android will let you know that skype is not responding and you can either wait or close the application.  If you start a video call, the UI is completely frozen and you cannot do anything until you kill it when the android dialog appears... Uninstall/Reinstall does not help.Having a Windows Phone, I agonize when I have to use any Google service, since Google intentionally makes a bad experience for WP users...  I hope this is not Microsoft's way of payback by making their software not work properly on Google's OS...  sigh..."
frustration,good/very bad app!!!,"good/very bad app!!!.

frustration,Updaaaaaaate!!!!,"Updaaaaaaate!!!!. This app is horrible and rarely updated much like hundreds of other Kindle apps. I use Skype every Friday. My call gets dropped about 7-8 times every 30 minutes if not more. When I attempt to call back, either the video or audio is gone. It's infuriating. If the Kindle can do no more than display books properly, why not buy a cheaper e reader? This is not the only app I have issues with but it's one of the main ones. I check for updates all the time, (despite the fact that my Kindle is set to automatically download any updates, which it does not) and there is never one to be found."
frustration,not to good,not to good. This app was okay I guess. I mean its good for video chatting and I love to do it but every time I try to call someone and they don't pickup even after I have quit I can still here that really annoying ringing noise! Its so frustrating! I even completely exit out of the app and I can still here it so I have to shut down my tablet and restart it all over again! So annoying! Also very laggy and sometimes slow. The picture is good I guess but please fix the stupid ringing noise!!!!! So annoying I just want to pick my tablet and throw it! ( I'm not that stupid don't worry) please fix this app so it will actually be good for video chatting. Yes I'm done now
frustration,Practically unusable for group chats.,"Practically unusable for group chats.. For one on one chats its fine. Maybe a little laggy at times but tolerable. I have a group chat active, however, and loading it up is almost impossible. It tries to load weeks of conversation which hundreds upon hundreds of messages. I can barely look at what's being said, even when the chat is quiet.. because it keeps loading older and older messages."
frustration,terrible,"terrible. It looks like since mid 2013 on forwards, Skype isn't worth downloading.  I bought two Kindle fires just so I could keep in touch with my parents, and the app crashes non stop. Call drops, app closes, calls won't go or come through (I called on cell phone, and could hear their Skype ringing from their end but I never got the call and vice versa). Once it gives you the error message if you don't close it, it'll crash your system. Freezes the screen, and you have to full power down. The only reason I bothered to review and rate one star at all is voice calling is superbly clear with minimal lag.  However two minutes into my voice call (because I gave up on video), I got the error that Skype was not responding.  My screen then froze completely. Couldn't even hit menu to go to home.  But my voice call never dropped, so I guess that's the one thing it has going for it."

frustration,"Skype is good, but the app for KFHD is AWFUL!","Skype is good, but the app for KFHD is AWFUL!. I like Skype on my computer, but this app is horrible. It's not compatible with Kindle Fire HD, no matter how you look at it. Not only does the app keep losing video and crash, it makes my device crash which is always terrifying because I never know if it'll ruin my Kindle forever. I uninstalled it from my device, and will not reinstall it until I hear it it once again compatible (if it ever is again). Until then, Oovoo is a much better and more reliable free video calling app."
frustration,Skype for KF needs an upgrade,"Skype for KF needs an upgrade. I know this most likely will not be noticed, but Kindle Fire Skype seriously needs an update, especially since I've been using the same old Skype for like 2 years now. Its weird when I'm roleplaying or doing the asters sentence asters thing and it doesn't bold like every other version of skype for every other device EXCEPT Kindle Fire. Or none of the newer emojis show, I've had the same boring ole emojis for years now!! I mean cmoon lol. And I cant recieve files anymore because Skype isnt updated, and that makes me sad!!! I mean I get it, there are plenty of other devices out there that need to be more updated then my old Kindle Fire, but i really would like to see a more updated version of Skype for kindle fire. I really hope both microsoft and amazon see this and think yes, we must update. It would be extremely appreciated"

frustration,Sucks,Sucks. Every time I try to video chat on my kindle it doesn't work. It always freezes and it exits me out or you can't hear me. I fixed everything that was wrong with my kindle or thought that was. And that wasn't the problem. Please fix it so I don't have trouble in the future.
frustration,Can't receive Skype voice calls,"Can't receive Skype voice calls. Everything works great... except I can't receive calls on my Fire Phone.  When I test, I get an error stating that ""your device currently cannot receive push notifications"".  My device can receive push notifications from other apps.... so I am not sure what is wrong."
frustration,Frustrating,Frustrating. I used to love Skype because it was a way to communicate with my friends and cousins across the world. I would have gave it a 5 star rating. But then one day it said my account was suspended and I couldn't use it when I tried to sign in. I read everything and it still wouldn't let me on. Then I decided to create a new account because my old one wouldn't let me on. I tried to make about ten different accounts with all different usernames but guess what? IT Wouldnt LeT me Sign IN!!! I hope the Skype creators can fix my account because it has been really frustrating.
frustration,unable to send photos... still,"unable to send photos... still. It's been well over a year since I've been able to send photos via Skype on the kindle fire. Both of my nieces have kindle fires and they have the same issue. I can send them photos from other devices (traditional computers, iPad, iPhone, and my Microsoft Surface) and they can receive those photos. But one cannot send jpegs via Skype for Kindle. This update did not address that issue."

frustration,New Skype is terrible,"New Skype is terrible. It drops calls, and the only way to fix it is shut down the kindle and reboot. Then works again for another 10 minutes and drops again. If you don't reboot it just goes crazy. It comes on the kindle when you buy it new so why isn't it more compatible. Used to love it now I hate it. Amazon fix it please or offer us a better app for video chatting."
frustration,Why?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"Why?!?!?!?!?!?!?!. I give this app 1 star because I can't give it a zero... I was in the middle of a chat with my friend, which I could barley hear and my volume was all the way up. Another friend tried to call me, but I didn't answer it. Then skype kept making this annoying beeping noises. My friend could hear them on the other line. No one was calling me so I knew it was a glitch... after 5 minutes, I got sick of the noise. I closed skype ans restarted it. THE NOISE DIDN'T STOP! I forced stop the app... guess what... IT DIDN'T STOP!!! I finally gave up and deleted the app... IT. DIDN'T. STOP.... finally, after a few more minutes, the noise stopped. I went to go download skype again, but it made my whole kindle glitch. No all my friends are expecting calls that I can't give... FIX THIS PLEASE..."
frustration,dont waste your space,dont waste your space. The latest update to allow friends to video chat was removed due to the kindle fire hd memory leaking and wont be getting anymore updates 😫😒💩 its not right for the developer to not update skype for kindle fire hd 3rd gen when a bunch of other apps are still being updated dont buy any kindles as they dont always get the same updates as android or google play
frustration,Useless app .....,Useless app ...... I downloaded this app to my Kindle because I use Skype routinely on both my desktop and laptop.  I have been unsuccessful in logging into the app because it keeps telling me that I'm already on it!I uninstalled it and reinstalled the app several times to no avail.  My advice: don't bother.
frustration,terrible performance,"terrible performance. I don't know what update people are referring to, but this app has never worked properly on my Kindle fire. It crashes ALL of the time. Every time I try to give it another chance, I regret it by the first call. Hate it. I wish they'd get it together because this would be a great app to have on the  Kindle."
frustration,Crashing and volume issues,"Crashing and volume issues. The main issue I have with Skype is the fact that it crashes constantly. I could be video chatting with someone or simply rotating my kindle before Skype decides it's too much for it to handle that it will crash. After the update, I also noticed I wasn't able to hear the person I called, even after raising the volume all the way up. Took me a while to realize that you can raise the volume specifically for Skype calls that you can ONLY access just as you are calling the person before they answer (you do this by pressing the volume control on the side of the tablet).PLEASE FIX THIS. It is very annoying and highly inconvenient."
frustration,This sucks,"This sucks. I used to use this app all the time, so that I could talk to my boyfriend and my friends since I'm away at college, but the app updated and now I can't make calls. I can't accept calls. AND THE APP KEEPS CRASHING. This is the only app I have that does this. And I'm so sad and frustrated. Yeah, I can call my friends, but I'd rather see their faces AND hear their voices. It looks like I'm going to have to fuss with and deal with Google hangouts or the Facebook video chat. Please update the app, SO THAT IT WORKS, HAS NO BUGS, AND DOESN'T CRASH. Thank you!"
frustration,Terrible!,"Terrible!. I have used Skype for quite a while, and recently skype had updated. I can no longer make calls nor receive them.  I think the problem has to do with the update and it should be fixed soon!"
frustration,Terrible!,"Terrible!. This app worked ok when I first downloaded it, but now it crashes my Kindle. If the program even starts to work, it freezes then crashes within about 60 seconds. Completely worthless."
frustration,Nonstop Crashing,"Nonstop Crashing. Before the update, my kindle could take video calls with no problem, recently I can't get a video call to last longer than a minute before the screen goes white and the app goes unresponsive. If I do manage to get back to the message screen without turning the kindle off, I can't call of anything without it crashing completely, so I have to turn it off and then on again. It will only take voice calls, which is very frustrating since I'm trying to keep in touch with close people across various countries and we would like to speak face to face. I have no idea what this is, and it's driving me nuts. Fix this app! I would like to be able to make video calls again, and I would like for files to show up again like it used to. Very annoyed."
frustration,rendered useless,"rendered useless. The new Skype download is nearly useless. Calls always fail and the video simply never works. If you are lucky, sometimes the audio will work in the background as the software crashes. Just don't press the wait or OK for a restart, then you can at least get a few words in. But that does not always work. If you video call, it crashes immediately. Too bad, it use to work."
frustration,Terrible update!,"Terrible update!. Up until this last week Skype has been a good app.  If an update is going to be pushed out, shouldn't a company make sure that it'll work properly?  After this last update I can't use Skype to video chat with my family!  Terrible update."
frustration,Won't stop crashing,"Won't stop crashing. In the middle of all my video chats, Skype will randomly crash and go back to the main page. After it crashes and I bring it back up, I can't make calls or answer calls without it crashing again. I always have to reset my kindle. It seems to work for a little bit, sometimes only a few seconds into a video chat, but it always crashes. I have very little way to contact people back home and this is the only way get to see them for months that I am away so I would really appreciate if all the s*** that is wrong with the app would be fixed."
frustration,Pathetic,Pathetic. This app used to work when I first got my Kindle. Then it updated and has never since worked properly. First there were problems with audio while on calls. Then it started crashing. Then the audio problems resolved with no aid from support. Now the video has started completely going black and the app will freeze and take me back to the friends screen. When I try and call back (it crashes the call) the video still does not work. Restarting the app does not work. Reinstalling the app does not work. Restarting the Kindle briefly worked but it quickly went back to doing the same thing. I have uninstalled the app and it will stay that way.
frustration,poor volume,poor volume. I have been using this app for well over a year. And it's been awesome.Then it recently updated and now the volume sucks and I can't hear the person on the other end and keeps shutting off and freezing. Please fix soon.
frustration,New Update.,"New Update.. The new update is horrible. First of all, if you are on a video call with someone and you try to put your video on, within ten minutes the whole page will turn white and crash. Also, it constantly will say ""Skype has stopped working, would you like to close it?"" You have no choice in the matter. If you don't close it, the same message will keep popping up, therefore FORCING you to close it. If you have an older version of Skype, keep it. You will not be able to get your old version back if updated to this version. Also, if you want to type a long message out, your keyboard will lag like crazy. I do not recommend this update to anyone."
frustration,Recently gotten HORRIBLE,"Recently gotten HORRIBLE. I used to get on skype almost every single day. I just recently got my internet back and i updated skype. BIG MISTAKE. I tried voice chatting with my friends in different states when not even 15 minutes into the call. It stops up. So i pull down my screen and clicked on skype where it said it had stopped up. I really want to talk to my friends but this is horrible. I am now switching to oovoo unless Microsoft can fix this utterly ridiculous app, that used to work perfectly."
frustration,Bad,Bad. Can't voice call on my kindle fair (3rd generation) this is horrible. I use it to talk to friends out of state and all I can do is message people. Fix it so it works on all kindle and phones.
frustration,Poorly Tested App,"Poorly Tested App. I am using this app on my new Kindle Fire HDX and I am not satisfied with its quality. For a few seconds immediately after the start of a video call there is thick green stinge on both the caller 's and the callee's videos. It goes away shortly after but is very annoying. The worst thing is, the app cannot do the logout properly. When I try to sign out, it crashes and when I reopen the app I am still logged in. The only way my wife could login is to uninstall the app and reinstall it! What a nuisance!"
frustration,It doesn't work on kindle,"It doesn't work on kindle. The only time I can Skype is if we are both calling each other simultaneously.  If not, then it rings incessantly, even if I shut the app off or even TURN THE VOLUME OFF!  The only solution that stops theincessant ringing is if I turn the device completely off."
frustration,:(,:(. Deletes my account every week so I have to make a new one and it won't work -23849989stars:(
frustration,Really stupid,Really stupid. I try to face time my bots but it doesn't work
frustration,Bring back the Skype version that came with my Kindle Fire HD,"Bring back the Skype version that came with my Kindle Fire HD. The version of Skype that came with my Kindle Fire HD 7 (previous generation) worked splendidly.  Then came these nasty messages from Skype saying that I had to upgrade to the current version.  ""had to"" because I couldn't get past these messages to use Skype.  OK...so I upgraded.  Now Skype doesn't work at all on my Kindle.  Period.  Am now using Yahoo Messenger instead.  What a joke this new version of Skype is.  Clearly it was not at all well tested before being released."
frustration,confused  and annoyed smh,"confused  and annoyed smh. This app is very buggy on a kindle fire. I have had it downloaded for years, and now it's saying I need the recent veesion. There's no update???? Honestly this is very annoying, please help? Lol"
frustration,Only part of it works,"Only part of it works. So I use Skype on my computer with little problem. The app for my kindle fire HDX will let me video chat with someone. The problem is that We can both hear each other, they can see me, but I can't see them.  Once this problem is fixed I will change my rating. Until then it only gets 3 stars."
frustration,sucks,"sucks. It was working just fine but then when i try to get on it it's telling me to get the newer version. Well i tried getting the newer version but then it said i cannot get that app because it's not for my mobile. The app said it's for android, and I'm using my android!! It sucks now don't get it. It's telling me to get the new version but it's not letting me. And the version i have now, will not let me in my account it's ridiculous..."
frustration,Canr even use it,"Canr even use it. On my kindle fire, I can't even download it! It just says open, but when I click open it just takes me back to the same oage! Pls help. Not sure if it is a app problem or a kindle problem."
frustration,Junk,"Junk. No matter how good my Internet is this program is always laggy. Terrible video quality and it will freeze and crash. Also the pip of my camera is large enough to obscure who I'm talking to, why can't I remove or shrink it? This app needs some serious fixes. Look elsewhere for video chat."
frustration,won't let me Create a account,"won't let me Create a account. I can't even deal with this I've tried and tried about like 50 times. After I put in all my info, and I press create It says"" I'm sorry but we can not log into this app right now, please check your mobile network"
frustration,=(,=(. First of all it asked me for my Microsoft account whose password I don't remember second of all when I filled out the forgot password thing and instead of sending a password  reset it asks to make a security code and when I fill that out every time I make a code it says sorry code didn't work try again I try again and again but it just doesn't work.
frustration,Yeeesh...Very Difficult To Set Up,"Yeeesh...Very Difficult To Set Up. Who designed this kludge? The Obamacare Dream Team Website Design Group?? Setting up an account is simple enough, but establishing contacts not so much. My wife and I tried to set up our accounts tonight and sent the requisite contact requests to each other. Neither one of us saw any requests come in, even tho we sent requests to each other. The help videos stop right where we stopped. The app looks okay on my 8.9-inch Kindle, but the words run together on my wife's 7-inch. Very poorly designed."
frustration,Breaks all the time,"Breaks all the time. This app, while being a great application - when it's working - for connecting with your friends, has so many issues. It constantly stops working, often gives me issues with signing in and I have to restart over and over again. I have had to uninstall it numerous times in order to fix it. These problems are so awful I think it should cost a negative amount and give you money to use their godforsaken app."
frustration,worse thing imaginable,"worse thing imaginable. I like to Skype with a friend who is stationed in Korea, well I'd like to. I'm unable to because the app constantly crashes or logs me out and won't let me log back in. It's really annoying. I can't wait for a company to create a different and better version of Skype so I could jump this sinking ship for something that actually works. Would not recommend to anyone and will never use again."
frustration,don't waste your time or money...,"don't waste your time or money.... Zero stars.  Crappitty crap crap crap.  Simply doesn't work without all the usual MS convoluted bug ridden ""enhancements"" to a frightfully incompetent, disasterously poor product.  Wait!  it doesn't work even with them!  it's even worse than i imagined.  it's caught me in an endless loop of failure, and sad for me, i can't get it to work and so they'll confiscate my credit; goodbye 7 euros.  bloody worthless."
frustration,Sucks big time,"Sucks big time. This app, after recent updates, has been the most frustrating experience. It hangs constantly, usually after I try to use video. The kindle HD becomes unusable after that and I have to turn it off and on again. Sucks!"
frustration,Video Freezes Constantly,"Video Freezes Constantly. The video freezes repeatedly on the Kindle Fire HDX Skype app.  I get about 20 seconds of actual video, then it freezes.  Call back and get another 20 seconds, then freezes.  Supremely frustrating."
frustration,"the update.... Oh, the update","the update.... Oh, the update. It's awful. It's crashing constantly and causing additional issues with my kindle. FIX IT. I want to be able to use it, but it needs work."
frustration,Skype on Kindle..Blows,Skype on Kindle..Blows. I have never been able to get a complete session active without Skype rebooting on the kindle. I think there is a problem with the camera process and Skype.It resizes and then goes into reboot.I hate it on the kindle
frustration,bad update but still good,bad update but still good. I hate the update every time I charge my kindle fire it makes me sign in I try to do it right but it's not working Skype please fix update I want new emoji and no signing in

frustration,Skype,Skype. Did not let me log in works horrible because I have a kindle fire and it just keeps on saying check WiFi connections
frustration,pending?,"pending?. Every time I send a message it says pending, and takes up to an hour to go through. Unbelievable. It's annoying when you wanna talk to friends"
frustration,Freezes,"Freezes. Used this app when I first got my Kindle Fire and it was GREAT.  After the updates it is awful!!!!!!!  Kids love to Skype with Daddy at work, but this app now freezes after less than a minute.  So frustrated, bring back the old app!"
frustration,Stupid Skype Keeps Shutting Down!,"Stupid Skype Keeps Shutting Down!. At first, Skype was awesome. Then a new version was downloaded onto my kindle fire HD. Now, it keeps breaking down and shutting down, and I have to turn my kindle if and on like 10 times a day for it to even work. This is horrible!!!!"
frustration,skype is broken,"skype is broken. Skype will not work on my Kindle Fire,  I click on the Skype icon, it opens for 0.2 seconds and then closes."
frustration,No. Just NO.,"No. Just NO.. I used to like Skype. A lot. But after it got updated, I HATE IT. Now I can't multitask as much anymore (as in talking on Skype and doing something else). Sometimes when I'm talking with someone on Skype and I go off the app to another one, it stops and disconnects my call. Yes, the appearance looks better, but technological wise, it sucks. Please get the bugs fix :/ I hate it. The camera on Skype is disoriented for my Kindle Fire. I thought maybe it was my device or internet connection, but I tried restarting it and everything, but the condition still is the same. It's bad for me that's why I'm leaving a review for those of you who haven't updated Skype yet to NOT UPDATE IT. Hopefully it gets better so I can change the star ratings :/"
frustration,terrible app!!!!!!,terrible app!!!!!!. Skype is a terrible app.  I put in an account and waited an hour for it to confirm my account. The next morning when I tried to log on it said the account didn't exist. Then me and my mom gave myself a new email for Skype and it took forever but it didn't work either.In conclusion I suggest that no one should buy this app.
frustration,doesn't work at all,doesn't work at all. This app is horrible not worth your time for it to download.  Can't hear anything and the picture doesn't work for the person you are talking to because it is so delayed.
frustration,works Horribly on fire.hdx!,works Horribly on fire.hdx!. Video works when it want to. Audio is always good. Huge delay in video and audio Timing. To get video back you have to restart your kindle.  Sucks!!
frustration,Update also ruined it for me as well.,"Update also ruined it for me as well.. Update also ruined it for me as well. Bought Kindle Fire HD with Skype pre-loaded, now, with the new app update, old app not loading and the update fails all the time. This effectively makes Skype app unusable. What is worse I sent the tablet oversees for my mom to use and she now is unable to use video to communicate, back to phone."
frustration,now nobody can hear me,now nobody can hear me. Ever since the new update on Kindle fire hdx callers cant hear me... echo test fails every time.
frustration,Fire HD user,"Fire HD user. The first few days all was fine, after that I stopped getting notifications and missed calls every time! It crashes for no reason, you can barely hear the person on the other end. It's all crap!"
frustration,terrible,"terrible. This new update is absolutely terrible!!! It kept freezing on me and when I tried to close it, it wouldn't! I had to keep turning my kindle on and off again! I finally said screw it n used my laptop"
frustration,Don't waste your time.,"Don't waste your time.. Upon finally getting it downloaded unto my Fire HD, couldn't sign in to save my soul. Don't bother with this one."
frustration,aww,aww. I cant see other peoples pictures unless I add them to contacts. I cant send pictures in my group only per person on my contacts. I can recive pictures in a group from others. Half the time I lose connection for a while and then get spammed by the sound like crazy. Wtf please fix it.
frustration,Very Unstable,Very Unstable. Whether or not it actually works varies from update to update. There are virtually zero adjustable call settings. It's hard to believe an app specially built for a single device can be so awful even YEARS after it was released. Skype for my junky phone works better than this.
frustration,skype is the worst now,"skype is the worst now. Since the last update on Kindle, Skype will constantly freeze video calls, drop calls, crash, and distort video, It desperately needs to be fixed by developers."
frustration,SKYPE Kindle HD,"SKYPE Kindle HD. I have yet to do what we purchased the Kindle for, to contact our grandkids. I have gone to Skype Help (nothing) and Amazon Help twice and I still am fighting with this. The Skype and Amazon instructions, in my case were useless. Your folks tried to assist me, but I am still trying to figure out what to do. As you can figure out I am not a great computer person. When they say it is easy, not for all people."
frustration,HELP ME!!,HELP ME!!. I can't connect to group chat. It's not fair that only kindle os get video calls. Please help me... I have a kindle HDX
frustration,Not working,"Not working. So, I went to Skype one of my friends, but it won't let me... It says call failed.... When I try sending messages, they won't go through... It was fine until now..."
frustration,Fails,Fails. The newest update cuts out every 2-3 minutes. Have to use my phone for Skype calls. Between bad apps and no apps... never again a Kindle Fire.
frustration,Needs work,"Needs work. Does not notify on Fire 10.  Keeps giving poor internet connection message,  next to modem.  List of calls cluttered and confusing; no way to clean up the clutter."
frustration,Horrible calling app,Horrible calling app. This app is horrible for calling. Everytime I would try it would force close and freeze. The messaging is actually good and it's easy to navigate.
frustration,update is not great,update is not great. This update current version on Kindle fire HD is really lacking it won't let me stay signed in constantly if I exit the app I am signed out asap it really needs to be fixed asap!! It's very annoying!!!
frustration,works,works. The app works but I find it seriously frustrating that there is no way to shut off its text correction.  The program continually changes words and it's driving me batty!
frustration,worst app evey,worst app evey. It logs me out when I'm talking to someone then I can't log back in.
frustration,"Get it together, Skype","Get it together, Skype. Terrible update, along with frequently not making any notification that I have any messages waiting, it constantly crashes my entire tablet without warning and forces it to restart whenever I am checking my contacts, messages or even just trying to open the app. Don't use of you don't absolutely have to, try to find an .apk online of an.older version if you can."
frustration,update needed asap,update needed asap. unable to connect. Ihave updated the app but it doesnt work
frustration,update ruined app,update ruined app. Skype was bad before always dropped my calls would crash randomly.. did update now it won't let me in at all just says I need to update!!  Skype needs to fix this
frustration,near crap,"near crap. First of all, never loads all my contact pics. Secondly, it always freezes up during any type of call, especially video. I'm lucky it even lets me see myself. Even when the video works, if eventually freezes and never works again ! Earlier today i got signed out for no reason! It doesn't even let me turn the view sideways when i turn the tablet vertical.ever since the update our whatever they did, the app has been crap, and hasn't gotten less crappy since. I'd rather just buy another Google powered tablet, but I'm stuck with this one for now..."
frustration,terrible update.,"terrible update.. Because of the new update, when I type a message, oftentimes it will glitch, and when I answer a call or video call, it will always freeze up for a moment, then the screen goes dark, then it will force close. Please fix this for a better rating, for now, if there was a half star, you would see it."
frustration,miserable app,"miserable app. I can't find anything in the settings, I can't delete conversations, it is super glitchy, I keep getting sent spam with inappropriate content. Should I go on? I can, this this can keep going, it doesn't connect to WiFi well, the emoji's and video clips hardly ever work, it takes 15 minutes to send pictures..."
frustration,Annoying,Annoying. Worked fine for a couple of days. Now I can't even use it as it automatically signs out on my kindle fire everytime I close the app.
frustration,Issues,Issues. Don't understand why I can join group calls on all other devices except on the kindle. It sits on the connecting screen then freezes the kindle...SKYPE GET THIS FIXED please
frustration,crashes,crashes. Well Skype is new on my kindle fire. I have had it for over a year with hardly any problems. Until now. It keeps crashing and I can't video chat at all. I don't know if it is just my kindle fire or Skype itself...but something needs to be fixed and I think it is the app.
frustration,problematic since update,problematic since update. This was an absolute must have app for any Kindle owners. Since the recent update the app loses video and crashes on every call. Very frustrating. I would go for another option until they can address the issues caused by the latest update.
frustration,Bad... do not download!,"Bad... do not download!. The update... ugh I don't even. Whenever I call someone, and I turn up my volume all the way, my volume just automatically turns off. I have to turn it back up again. And you should really update it by giving an option of 'delete conversation'. I'd rather not have my friends browsing through my messages."
frustration,Will not sign in.,Will not sign in.. I don't know how many times a Skype account needs to be recovered by Tim done. This app is worthless. Can't even sign in after going through all the recovery and reset garbage.
frustration,why!!!!,"why!!!!. Dear skype: this new version lags so much, that it's impossible to text anyone. There is lag everywhere. In the photos, in the text, in the phone calls EVERYWERE it's the only thing I have to text with, so...........crap. don't download."

I don't have any mobile networks. I am connected to WiFi. It didn't require a mobile network before and shouldn't require one now. I am so frustrated! If anyone knows how to fix this where I can use my WiFi let me know.

frustration,Bad update!,"Bad update!. The new update ruined my Skype! Do not install it! It turns off and screen becomes white and then even if I restart my kindle, I cannot see the person I'm calling. Happens all the time! Welp!!!"
frustration,Wasted enough time on this,"Wasted enough time on this. Worthless app.  Amazon tells me I have the latest update, my kindle tells me I need to check my mobile network settings.  Neither amazon or Skype offer any intuitive ways to get of square one.  Wasted enough time on this."
frustration,Audio and video ALWAYS out of sync,Audio and video ALWAYS out of sync. Every single video call has the audio and video out of sync by several seconds... This only happens on Skype for Kindle (Fire HDX)

frustration,Crashes on Kindle,"Crashes on Kindle. I've had a horrible experience with this app while deployed.  Skype is great on other systems, but constantly crashes or disconnects when talking to others.  Too bad, since this was one of the primary reasons I bought the Kindle."
frustration,it's terrible,"it's terrible. I love my cellphone, but this app doesn't work well, when I'm using the other person on the line only can hear me if I use the headphones. Please try to fix this problem,I don't want to return my phone."

frustration,Awful,"Awful. It's a great app, if you're a fan of constant crashes that require a full restart of your Kindle before you can use it again.  And if you like five minutes intervals between crashes.  I've waited a few months for a fix and haven't seen one.  What gives???"

frustration,waste of time,"waste of time. It doesn't work properly. It opens but has no volume and then constantly crashes. I was forced to update and it was a waste of time, I'm deleting it!"
frustration,Not a working app.  Will not allow area code to be entered,"Not a working app.  Will not allow area code to be entered. I am really peeved that the Skype download for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 does not allow for you to add the area/local code, so that you can obtain a number for your device on the local network.  This renders video chatting with other friends on Skype useless, since they have no contact number with which to reach you.  I tried to delete it twice and reload the application, and even tried the android application.  Nothing I did corrected the problem.  If you don't put the area code in and just have the state, like Texas, it gives you a phone area code for San Antonio, which is 5 hours away.  Someone needs to seriously look at this and make a correction to the app., or give us a way to fix it.  Skype is one of the main video chatting apps that most people use.  Had I known it was useless I would have spent my money on the Ipad, but i figured all i needed was to video chat and didn't need to have a camera on the back for vidoes and pictures that the Ipad includes.  At least Ipad can use SKYPE!  I'd give this app a zero if it allowed...."
frustration,frustrating,"frustrating. Tried to use this to tall with family overseas. Absolutely terrible. The video quality is okay. But the audio both ways is garbage. I can't hear audio coming in.

frustration,Less than impressed,"Less than impressed. I studied German in college many years ago.  I selected the Duolingo German option.  I found it difficult to clearly hear each word that was spoken.  Too bad that native speakers cannot say a word slowly and distinctly, then say it as in normal conversation.  Also, just beginning, I found strange situations.  The word for ""boy"" in German is ""Der Knabe""..as a second choice ""Der Junge"".  Duolingo offers only the word ""Der Junge""...which generally means ""the youth""...and the article ""Der"" makes it male.  Maybe a little knowledge is not a good thing.I also found it very difficult to go where I wanted to in the program."

It does however have little annoyances that need to be addressed. Some of the translators for the 'speak and type what you heard' entries speak HORRIBLY, and are very difficult to hear even when you hit the 'Slowly' button and the speaker breaks down the sentence. I took 2 years of German in high school and just WASHED OUT of Duolingo's German placement test, largely due to the fact that the translator sounds like she has gum in her mouth!!!! 😈😈😈😈 Additionally, I found the Irish language translator it too quiet to hear even with my Kindle at maximum volume!! Please address these issues."
frustration,"Not really ""Free""","Not really ""Free"". While the approach is engaging and fun to use, I find this supposedly free ap extremely frustrating.  It only allows you to make 5 ""mistakes"" before you must either buy more health or wait several hours to continue.  This is annoying because I only have a limited time to study Italian before embarking on a trip to Italy and having to come to a stop when I have time to study makes me crazy. I don't expect to be speaking Italian but just wanted to have some exposure and basic vocabulary,  This would be fine for that if minor grammar errors didn't keep stopping me."
frustration,"great learning program, buggy app","great learning program, buggy app. Duolingo is an incredible learning program that I've been using for a long time - on my computer. This app normally doesn't give me problems, but lately it's been exiting out of a lesson (or worse, a test) randomly and my progress is lost completely. It's really frustrating! I don't know if it's only me, but I would recommend using duolingo on some other device like a computer or even an iPod or iPhone."
frustration,freezes kindle,freezes kindle. It was ok but lessons were very repetitious and slow and it froze my kindle fire after a couple lessons. I had to perform a hard reset.

frustration,Amazon store version is useless,Amazon store version is useless. I'm an existing Duolingo user with the Play Store version on my phone. I downloaded the Amazon Store version to my Kindle Fire only to find I can't use the app as I signed up using my Google + account and there's no support for it in this version. I'm guessing it's the same for the Amazon version loaded onto an Android phone too. Sadly another example of Amazon apps lagging behind those on Play Store & 1 Market.

No keyboard shows up, and he can't even click ""check"" (and get it wrong) to move on to the next question. It's frustrating, to say the least."
frustration,Like it,"Like it. Its fun, but every single time I go onto the app Food 2 is weakened. I get every single one correct! I am learning Spanish. Plus it never makes it clear when to use escribe or escriben or escribed or whatever. Plus when it says to listen then type it in I can't because I'm in bed at night or in a public place. Also the idioms is just terrible in my opinion. It was a huge waste of time. I just hate it how I never get a word wrong but I still have to redo every lesson"
frustration,Great Until Its Not,"Great Until Its Not. I love this app, usually with language apps it's either hit or miss with most of them on the miss side. This app actually teaches you not only vocabulary but also grammar in a very concise step by step guide. I'd say it's almost like a mini Rosetta stone. My problem comes when I'm in the middle of a lesson and all of a sudden it goes back to the menu. I'm using kindle fire HDX so I don't know if that has something to do with it. It's incredibly annoying and frustrating when you have to do the same lesson five times because of crashes. I really enjoy this app, and it's actually helping me learn some Spanish but I'm going to be forced to stop if I can't move forward. Please fix this."

Could be improved with a word list and a sample of conjugated verbs.  Starts out by ""testing"" which is more gamelike, but you lose hearts when you can't answer a question that asks you for a word that you've never heard or seen in writing.  That part is likely due to the random selection of questions from the ""test bank.""  This wasn't too bad in German and Spanish which I had some familiarity with, but French is completely new, so this shows up more often.  The spoken words are sometimes difficult to understand, too."

I however found it frustrating because  it never provides a ""vocabulary list, verb declension tables or English help anywhere in the program. I ended-up switching it to German, which I do speak, and  used it as a review. It was super as a ""refresher"" course but  for me it was a failure as a cold start introduction to Vietnamese. I am currently using the Latin program to ""retrieve"" my high school Latin."

frustration,Needs improvement on all platforms,"Needs improvement on all platforms. Let me start by saying that I have the iOS version, which is installed on both my iPhone and iPad.  It was as five-star app for a while, until iOS 7 was released.  I think they released one update that made it compatible with 7, but it came with an annoying bug - it makes you log in EVERY SINGLE TIME you want to access your recipe box, even though I had the ""keep me logged in"" thing checked off.  Very annoying.  I let the app developers know about this, they say they are aware of it, and it will be fixed in the next update.  This was months ago, I am still waiting for that update.When I saw that the Kindle Fire version was free (I paid $1.99 for the iOS version), I decided to give it a try and see if I can use it and avoid the log in issue.  That part worked.  What DOESN'T work is inside the recipe box itself.  When I tap on one recipe, it takes me to a completely different recipe.  It's not like I tapped the one next to it by mistake; it takes me to recipes that aren't even next to the one I tapped on.  This makes the whole recipe box feature almost useless; what is the point of having it if you can't quickly access the exact recipe you want?  Apps like this are supposed to make life easier, but this one in any form is more hassle than it is worth.  Maybe I'll try it again, if they EVER update it.  I'm not holding my breath waiting for that, though.  It's actually easier now to just go to foodnetwork.com on my device, log in there, and access my recipe box that way."

frustration,poor functionality,"poor functionality. Many things work poorly in this app. Scrolling through search results keep coming back to the recipes, as if it can't keep track of what page it's on. You can't add a recipe to the recipe box at all, at least not intuitively. Many recipes are repeated. There doesn't seem to be any organization to the recipes such as by tags, cooking methods, etc. I could go on and on. This app was written by amateurs. I ditched it and just used the website."
frustration,Wanted to like it - Kindle Fire HDX,"Wanted to like it - Kindle Fire HDX. HATE that in every page of my recipe box there is an advertisement ""Holiday Celebrations - sponsored by Kohl's"". There should be an option user can select to NEVER see these. Many of my saved recipe links open up the wrong recipe. Not just ones I added today. I do not see an option to remove recipes from box either. I HATE that when I look at a recipe from a search list and then arrow back to the search list I get back to a different place than I left off. Often times right back to the beginning. This app is almost useless. Will NOT be using again before next update."

frustration,"As usual, update ruined it!","As usual, update ruined it!. This app is pretty, has a TON of recipes, and is fun to use in the kitchen. At least, it was. As per usual, their last update screwed it all up. My recipe box-which now includes Kohl' s sponsored recipes that I didn't even choose-is a complete disaster. You select a recipe,and it pulls up another one entirely-every time. I have to look in my recipe box, then search the whole app for the specific title to be able to open it. Ridiculously annoying. This didn't start until 'Kohl' s' started choosing recipes for me. In addition, it crashes constantly and you cannot make folders within your recipe box, though it appears that you can. I have uninstalled and reinstalled hoping that would help. No such luck. I really hope they fix this app, because it was one of my favorites."

frustration,Microsoft needs to update Skype on Amazon,"Microsoft needs to update Skype on Amazon. I find it very curious that Microsoft hasn't bothered to update Skype on the Amazon App Store. I have Skype on my work PC, my personal Mac, my Android mobile device and am used to receiving an update every week on those devices.

Volume control only after conversation start, before that you can only adjust an other volume, look s like the warnings. This is the only app what adjust something else what they should. No Mic sensitivity setup, on phone no camera or selection. They made a good app to pain to use, so you look for an alternative. If Google hangout stars to work on kindle, this one is gone.One star because the last version was broken too, but at least that was worked."

frustration,😕,😕. I would give Skype 5stars if I didn't have to keep on uninstalling and download. Be careful if you get this app it might log you out automatically and if you log back in if you try it will say unable to sign in then you have to uninstall it and download it again.

frustration,terrible,terrible. When I got this app I couldn't even set up an account because it kept saying something was wrong with my password and said my phone number was invalid when I've been using it for face time forever and to call!

I think the new update needs a patch because when i turn on my video in a call after a few seconds the app freezes and if i try to get back on, i cant make or receive calls.

frustration,PDF Max Pro doesn't play well with marshmallow,I wouldn't even give it a one if I could. I will not even put documents or PDF books in library. I would appreciate my money back. It won't open anything. This may cause me to go back to Barnes and Noble.
frustration,I'd recommend trying to email the developer first to ensure you ...,"The app works great for reading and annotating PDFs.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, and I'm finding it fairly intuitive to use the tools to mark up PDFs with the stylus.  But there is a bug or some other problem that has caused me a big headache.  Twice, my marked-up document has disappeared from storage, causing me to have to redo hours' worth of work.  This happened with two different documents.  I carefully saved after each change I made, and I made note of the file name and location, but the next day, in each case, the file was completely gone.  I searched through my entire file system and did not find it, and the storage location itself (PDFMax folder on the internal storage card) had been wiped.Until I find an alternative app, I am saving to my Dropbox account, which is slower and very clunky, and apparently has not saved the changes I re-made after losing the original file.  I really need an app that will reliably save changes and not delete files.  I thought this was it.  It is not.  Too bad, because other than that big deal-breaker, it works very well."
frustration,"Alright, but EZ PDF is better.  (One Reason Only)","Has a lot of good features. I'm not going to go over them as that's pointless; you can read the description of product or look at other reviews.I'm using a Samsung 8 inch tablet so for some reason when in landscape(horizontal) mode, the view is zoomed in too much so I often have to scroll down a little bit to see text at the bottom of my lecture notes. I cant zoom out so that the entire slide fits the height of my screen.  This is not a problem when in vertical mode though, everything is smaller (as expected), but that's why I prefer to edit in landscape mode. When switching from horizontal to vertical mode (vice versa) it teleports your view to somewhere else on the slide and zooms in...this is really annoying especially when annotating/editing.While free hand draw is amazing for writing out text with a stylus, however, the most important feature: typed text option(they call it freetext) does not even come close. The font color default is white...annoying when your first typing out text. The textbox that forms around the typed text is too big, I hate having to resize it to size of text, should make it automatic like in Adobe PDF. The fill in background color option for the textbox is extremely buggy especially when viewing in edit mode. The color wheel is weird and doesn't properly show no color option. There are no options to change type of font, font size, or highlight/underline (etc) the text you've typed out.There's no ""save as"" option though there is a backup option before each initial edit. The only way to save your file is when you exit the pdf.I can't tap to turn the page, only swiping can do that right now. They should add in the option of ""viewing mode"" aka full screen mode or maybe just have an area of the screen where I can just tap to turn page instead of bringing up the annoying edit UI.Any edit you make on this app does not do well with other pdf apps such as Adobe PDf app as mentioned by another reviewer. The edits are not visible on Adobe PDF. Not sure if the edits are shown on the computer.They should add more options so I can customize it to my liking.I think I'll stick with the native Adobe PDF app to annotate my lecture notes for now because it's simple and reliable."
frustration,College Student review,"This would be a fantastic app except for one big thing ... highlight, underline and strikethrough all all yellow! That's fine for the highlighter. Strikethrough should be red; underline should be green or bright green. It is impossible to see either of these two on a white background (not all pages are viewable in night mode) and this is how other apps like Adobe do it.Currently, to use underline or strikethrough, you longpress on the word, drag the tabs and then tap on underline or strikethrough. Then you have to tap elsewhere on the page; and then retap the word so it in an editing box, select the color pallete and set the strikethrough or underline color ... EVERY TIME!There are no options to set the default colors of these three actions, and that's what is keeping it from being a great app."
frustration,Nice app except for one BIG thing,"I got a new tablet with Marshmallow.  Apparently the app has been abandoned, because I get ""invalid file"" every time I try to read a file into the app.  This is not just a tablet problem, because I just checked my phone that has Marshmallow, and that also gives the same message."
frustration,I got a new tablet with Marshmallow. Apparently the ...,"Seeing as how this app is as expensive as many office suite apps I was expecting a bit more.  Yes it does annotations.  It is clunky and crashy and what is worse you can't save a file natively.  You can export it to Dropbox which is a good save alternative but that should remain an alternative.  The best I could manage as a work around is sending it to myself as a ""share to email"" and then saving the attachment.Features I would like to see from an app this expensive but not currently available:Save locallyPrint support (specifically google's cloud print)Print annotations to PDFI'm sure I could think of a few more but these would make a far better app."
frustration,"Do you update to 4.6.4, it's broken!","I tried my best to give a benefit of a doubt. But at the end I gave up. I was studying a pdf file, high lighting, underlining, commenting, making notes etc. to my surprise it started to crash on the 9, out of the 10 pages document. Before this happened the text I wrote on it kept on freezing I had to wait for the tablet to respond after 40 second or so. The worst part is that if you want to open this document using Adobe reader the only thing that is saved are the high lights and the comments. I cleaned the tablet (galaxy tab 3 8 note) from the junk, the memory and killed background tasks, I uninstalled/installed but that didn't help either Arrrghh! to think that I spent 2 hours in this so important document only to re-studying again."

Samsung Galaxy 2, Android 4.4.4.Loaded with all sorts of very nice features, but it fails at the most basic task; reading PDF's.Perhaps this app has too much max and not enough basic functionality or perhaps 280 MB of available RAM is not enough to load a 250 MB file.Whatever the case, this app does not work with large files (Consumer Reports, etc).Got this free here on the FAOTD"

frustration,Won't open....... Problem fixed,"Like others, I began receiving the ""invalid file!"" message when attempting to open any pdf file with PDF Max Pro after upgrading to Marshmallow.

Time of death March 4, 2017 11:39."
frustration,Refund my account.....,DO NOT WASTE YOUR $4.00. APP DOESN'T EVEN OPEN. Why is there no refund option like on regular Android devices. SCAM!!!!!!!
frustration,Don't work.,Never opens and will not open any pdfs.  Waste of money.  Please remove this app from the AppStore!
frustration,Doesn't work on Kindle Fire 10,"Adding strikethrough or underline to a document repeatedly gives ""Unfortunately, PDF Max has stopped.""Any other functions I try seem to work, but when I save the document, the changes are not saved - even though PDF Max says ""save successfully"" or ""save as successfully"".Nice concept, but not worth using if the changes are not saved!"
frustration,"Crashes repeatedly on some actions, cannot find saved documents.",I scanned a multiple page document at work.  When I opened it in PDF Expert the document was unreadable because the pages were offset such that it looked like the scan started half way through the page. At first I thought there was a page sizing issue but I opened the scan in a different PDF reader at the pages displayed correctly so the issue is with PDF Expert. I have other PDFs that displayed properly in PDF Expert but I may as well stick with my other PDF reader that works for all my PDFS.
frustration,Does not display PDF properly,"Really want to like this app. Highlighting/annotating is very quick and intuitive on the Kindle Fire HDX (compared to the Adobe Reader app), but will not email annotated PDF's or send them to DropBox. Every time I try, the app crashes and I am told ""PDF Max has stopped working."" In short, no annotations I make are saved properly. Needs an accessible save button that will back up the updated file on the tablet."
frustration,"Good bones, but crashes on dropbox/email connection","I find this little app very easy to use. However, I have a major issue with it on my galaxy tab S. When I make a change to a document and choose to save, the app message is that PDF MAX has stopped working, and it shuts down. I was able to use the stamp feature to insert an image and save that.  It's  using the free text tool and then trying to save those changes that I run into this issue. I've  tried save, and save as, and different locations, as weĺl as the default location with no luck."
frustration,editing closes program,downloaded and deleted
frustration,Never used it,It is impossible to use this app. There seems to be no way to navigate to where my documents are. A total scan and waste of money!
frustration,Worst app I've ever bought!,"I have a Samsung Galaxy 4 and tablet.  My job is such that I often download attachments from my emails on my phone/tablet.The PDF opens them well; however, the menu bar is confusing making it difficult to edit and save the PDF's.  This was a today's deal.  It definitely is not worth the current selling price of $7.99."
frustration,"Good app for viewing PDF's, but hard to use","DOES NOT WORK, DOES NOT LOAD ON MY KINDLE FIRE. I CHECKED TO MAKE SURE I AM RUNNING THE CURRENT OS SOFTWARE. THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT DISPLAY THE PDF DOCUMENTS THAT I HAVE IN STORAGE ON MY KINDLE. THE DOCUMENTS WILL DISPLAY IF I USE SILK BROWSER AS THE READER, BUT DOCUMENTS WILL NOT DISPLAY IN ""PDF MAX PRO.""  LOOKED FOR A TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE OR FAQ BUT THERE IS NOT ONE."
frustration,"program does not work, does not load on my KINDLE FIRE HD",It won't open at all. I want a refund
frustration,Doesn't even open--refund please,"I love the app. However, it does crash on me many times. If you do not save as you edit your pdf files, you can lose your work. I would give it 5 stars if it didn't crash on me most of the time. I still use it because most of my professors post their notes online as pdf files. I find it easier to write notes on my tablet without having to carry many sheets of paper around."
frustration,Great but it crashes often,"From some time the app shows invalid file when trying to open almost any PDF, I used to love the app and reinstalled hoping they fixed the problem, it doesn't work!!!"
frustration,Now it doesn't work,"I like this app's features.  Pretty handy to have for modifying PDF files.  But I don't understand why the latest update requires reading users identities? Until I understand the purpose of the requirement or they take it away.  Only 2 ☆worthy to me,  sorry."
frustration,Pretty okay.,"Looks like when I went to s7 I lost function of this app.  Invalid file error.  Was working file on s4.  My guess is android 6?  Please fix, will rerate when it works."
frustration,Invalid file,This app won't launch and isn't compatible with computer i needed for. Looking for refund. But there is no refund option. Wrote to support. Guess I'll see what happens...
frustration,This app has a persistent notification that won't go away...,"Since my tablet was updated with Android 7.0 this no longer functions. It will start okay, but when you try to open an existing doc or create a new doc it abnormally terminates. No response to my inquiries for help."
frustration,Does not work with Android 7.0,Dont work!!!!!!!!!!!! Trash!!!!!!! My money  back!!!!! I can't return.
frustration,Features are not functioning,I am rating this product 1star because the system would not let me rate it zero stars. This product would not load on my iMac because I am using an Amazon Firestick on my TV. Bizarre!
frustration,App crash,I paid for it and I cant even use it. Inregret of buyimg this tablet brand. there are no apps available and the ones available are a disapointment.
frustration,Better than most,"I have used this app a few times and enjoyed the functionality. The problem is that it crashes just as much as it works.  Great concept or not, the app has to run without crashing!  Will give it a 4 or 5 when they fix the issue."
frustration,Great.... When it works,This is a full feature PDF viewer/editor that's really good WHEN IT WORKS.  About half the time I try to open a document and a blank screen is all I get.  I have to close the app and reopen the document for it to work.  Fix this and I would definitely recommend.
frustration,Is good when it works,"Garbage.  Every pdf file I try to open it says ""invalid file"". Thieves."
frustration,Useless,"Would rate 0 stars if possible, and would like my money back, because the app closes every time I try to open a file."
frustration,"Great for reading, good for annotating","This app is great on my fifth generation fire, but it completely crashed on my seventh generation. I have not found any other pdf reader app that works as well as this does on my older fire for my newer. It is so frustrating to not be able to have all my pdfs as easily accessed on my newer version. One of the best features is that it shows thumbnails and not just the Adobe symbol. This is great for organizing crochet paterns. If only it would work."
frustration,Not working in my tab,"For $8, I had expected more. Maybe it is the operating system (Android), but this is a poor product. Many free ones that are similar and even better.Don't waste your money.  Also my old windows tablet and phone have better PDF apps"
frustration,Crap app.,CRASHES INSTANTLY ON AMAZON FIRE. DO NOT BUY!
frustration,Not forking on my Fire HD 8 (2016),Why am I forced to look at this obnoxious tool bar when I'm trying to read a PDF? there is no obvious way to hide this thing! I can't rate it higher than one star because it useless for reading PDFs!
frustration,Why can't I hide the stupid toolbar?,I should have believed the reviews. Crashes on everything that I try to open. Waste of money. Big disappointment!
frustration,Needs (lots of) work...,Don't like the fact that you can't change the font size or turn to night time view. When you let it read for you you can't move it forward you have to wait for it to get to the part you want.
frustration,"In the Evernote app, for Android, click on ...","I don't read that many PDF files period, much less on a smart phone or notepad. But at $8 for the app, and it being free today, I figured it was worth a look. And my first look was unimpressive. Really? No one could take the time to write an introduction or some basic instructions? For $8? This is a perfect example of why I don't buy apps I can't try.I would suggest to the developer to include a sample PDF document, so that when you open the app, you can see that it actually works. Better yet, use that sample PDF document as a mini-tutorial.I've been working with computer technology since the 1980s and can certainly figure how to work this app. But I like to speak up for those less experienced and made to feel stupid because they can't figure something out...when the real problem is not the user but the software."
frustration,I'm having issues with this app. help!,"I'm not sure it's seven or eight dollars good. It works as the free app of the day, but I'd be hesitant to spend money on it."
frustration,Sometimes It Works and Sometimes It Doesn't,Crashes every single time. Need a refund asap.
frustration,Since this requires being logged in to Amazon Appstore (WHY ...,I have downloaded the software at least a dozen times and still could not install it on Samsung Galaxy S4 with the Android 4.4.2 operating system.  The installation process never completed and software not installed.  This was the first software package that failed to install on my phone.
frustration,Terrible!,I download and install the app but when i click to open i get a message something like camelia.com stop working.  I tried several times and i still get the same error message.This  is the paid version
frustration,Not working,It might be an ok product but I'll never know.Listed as compatible but it isn't.
frustration,Doesn't Work on Samsung,"It's okay,  but doesn't have the feature I am looking for. I give it 3 stars because it was free."
frustration,App doesnt open,Displays  PDFs well but adding free text is just a nightmare. You can wait seconds for a letter to appear and the keyboard gets confused when you try use all caps.
frustration,free text edit like a snail moving backwards,WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
frustration,Working on BB10,"This app is useless since it will not connect to any Cloud service to import documents.  Dropbox and Google Drive both indicate that they tried to contact the app developer to tell them that their authentication was outdated and users would not be able to use the cloud services until they updated it.  Who knows how long ago that was.  In the technology world, this is business suicide. I made the mistake of paying for this app and it doesn't even work for what I need it for.  So don't waste your money.  Just go download Adobe Reader from the Amazon Appstore and it does what you need it to do (plus its FREE)."
frustration,Not working,This app doesn't and is broken!
frustration,Don't purchase!!!!,That's what I get when trying to open any PDF.
frustration,"Okay, usually does what it is supposed to do","The application has several interface problems and is not usable for my main type of annotations using free text. Hard to add, edit, reposition free text. With fast typing, the app can’t catch up and letters disappear. Removing annotations is painful. Many other usability issues. I recommend professional usability testing. Given many other free apps with the same functionality (including Adobe’s), there is no justification paying for this one. Hope, future versions will do a better job."
frustration,Worst PDF annotators among those I tried,"Doesn’t work on kindle, won’t load files"
frustration,great all around except for one minor flaw,"This says ver. 4.3.0  The Play store is ver. 4.4.1, why the difference?  Is it free because it's an older version?"
frustration,P.O.S.,Tried three times... I had hoped that android and samgsung had worked this nonsense out.
frustration,Invalid file,"Very nice piece of software,  very handy and nicely working but I give only three stars because it way impossible watermarking a PDF document.  Stamping it is OK; watermarking, despite being listed as one of the features,  was found nowhere to be applied."
frustration,Three Stars,"Wanted to use this to read PDF magazines on my Fire (original).Too crashy.Also, would have liked it to keep my place automatically.Probably not what this app was meant for.Too crashy.Probably good at what it was meant for though."
frustration,Good idea. Crashy.,YES
frustration,It crashes repearedly on my kindle fire hd,ok
frustration,Doesn't work,App doesn't work properly on my Kindle Fire HDX.  When first installed it worked.  After I closed & reopened the app it stopped working..  When I open a document it closes the app.  Uninstall & reinstall made no difference.
frustration,Did not work,"Every time I attempt to open a PDF file, I receive an *invalid file!* notice, and then the app immediately closes. Call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure PDFs are what this app is made for. I have tried multiple PDF files, all with the same results. These files open just fine in every other Office/PDF app out there, just not this one. I have even uninstalled and then reinstalled twice, with no luck. I have tried contacting customer support, but have not received a reply. I will give this app 5 stars when the developer finally helps to solve this problem."
frustration,Only get Invalid file message!,I used to use this all the time. Now anytime I try yo open file it says invalid file. Files open with other apps. Not sure if the app updated that caused this but please fix..was a great app.
frustration,Stopped working,"It must be a good app but does not work on my Jolla, which is not, I think, the fault of the app only."
frustration,PDF Max isn't working on my Jolla,"I know it supposed to work smooth and all. But for some reason, it always stop. I'm using Samsung Note 4 with ebooks on my memory card."
frustration,App will not open,"Can confirm as reported, no go on the Toshiba Thrive tablet."
frustration,Beware!,"Not so hot, not user friendly."
frustration,Doesn't work,great
frustration,excellent app but hungry for ram,"It's a great app, maybe the best for pdf docs, but, I have problems with my bookmarks, every time I close the app and open it again, I loose all my bookmarks, is really frustrating"
frustration,it doesn't work on toshiba thrive,"😬 All the tool work very poorly ,and some time don't even to do anything it frustrating"
frustration,Doesn't  work at all,"Sometime ago it just stopped working. Whenever I try to open any file, it just closes the app. I can open the app with no doc, but as soon as I try to load one it closes. Same thing happens when you try to use it from another app (such as opening a doc from email). Used to be good. Now useless!"
frustration,Can't reload purchased app,This app works really well except when you close it it creates a blank notification that you can't remove (HTC One M7). I really hope this gets fixed.
frustration,"Good app, annoying notification",Its an ok app. The only thing is when I close the app and reopen it  everything I highlighted disappears.
frustration,Broken,still some problem
frustration,chrashes and bugs,Program doesn't work.  Contact with company through email an website failed.
frustration,Useless application.,Misleading
frustration,Not working,Requires Amazon App is installed all time. No good.
frustration,Ehhhhh,There is an issue with bookmark drop down. It keeps exiting the program. Please fix it. Thank youI will check back later for an update.
frustration,bookmark menu needs to be fixed,Tried several times
frustration,Can't install. Keeps failing install,"This was originally a great app, now I get invalid file all the time. It cannot open a single pdf. It is useless on my phone (OP3)"
frustration,Broken,Its ok. I wish there were better ways to edit it like drive though. Otherwise its a good app .
frustration,Crashes!,Its alright
frustration,Does not work,"The top reviews for this app are from a few months ago, but recently they've changed the permissions required to use the app. It now includes the very dangerous ability to create user tokens. WATCH OUT!!"
frustration,Will not install,Installed easily.  Then did not work.  I guess that's worth one star since Amazin keeps askin me to review it.
frustration,"An excellent editor, but...","You've all heard the story before: really great app until the update. This was by far the best pdf app anywhere until their latest update made it almost impossible to scroll down.  They've got a goofy system that hides the navigation bar when you scroll,  but it takes about a second for the bar to hide. During this second you're just sitting there. Then if you want to scoll down again, you have to wait another second!  Please fix this or put in a settings menu that will allow us to disable the navigation bar hiding feature."
frustration,"Unable to use, stop working while editing photos.","I am not happy with this application.  At first it was  working very well and all of a sudden it goes  wacky. The  thing is that I paid $3.99 for this, and would like my money back."
frustration,Not A Happy Customer,"It is OK needs a lot of updated features.  I am an iAnnotate PDF user for along time on my iPad which I use constantly for teaching and preaching.  But when I use my iPad for presenting a powerpoint I needed something for my notes.  I am using a Kindle Fire HD 8.9"".  It does not have enough of the features or as easy to use as iAnnotate.  It looses the annotations and I have to keep bookmarking the page where I left off."
frustration,useless on Samsung Note 3,"I use this app to read PDF files. I would hate to have to annotate, export, or manipulate files on my tablet with it. I just don't think any touchscreen can replace a mouse and a huge monitor."
frustration,Ridiculously unstable,not  good wont work on my kindle HD
frustration,not good wont work on my kindle,"Got this when it was free and ended up removing. It worked ok, however, there is now free software which does more and does it better."
frustration,useless app,... After trying to update I can't install it anymore.
frustration,Was nice while it was working,"It asked two days ago....I would have said this app works great.  But two days ago it stopped working.  My files are there, but when I go to open one of them... it kicks me out of the app, and back to the home screen. What the heck!"
frustration,One Star,It's good. The print is a little blurry for a second when first appearing that doesn't happen with other reading apps.
frustration,"Unstable, not recommended","Doesn't really do much for me. Not bad, not great either."
frustration,Doesn't work,"While opening a PDF file in my Nexus 7 (2013-Wifi Only Tablet) , the original Font style of that PDF file changed! The file doesn't appear in its Original form. Ultimately, reading becomes pathetic. This problem doesn't exist in my Uncle's Samsung Galaxy E7 smartphone. This app is functioning there normally. Please Fix this issue at the earliest."
frustration,Not Satisfied,Highlighting a single line is very difficult.
frustration,Not Pleased,I barely use this app.
frustration,Invalid file,"The only reason I ordered the PDF Max 4, etc. was it said it was Free; It had better be, even though I can use that particular app."
frustration,Can't open files in Android 7,What's the difference between the free version and $7.99 version? Looks exactly the same.
frustration,Bookmarking crashes,nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App nice App
frustration,One Star,Upgrade. Is required.
frustration,APP WILL NOT OPEN IN MY TOSHIBA THRIVE!!!,"Please Please fix the annotation flattening! This would be an awesome app if I could flatten, making it possible to email and print my documents with my annotations included. Right now I do my annotations in PDF Max and then open the document in ezPDF to flatten. MAX is great at entering text and signatures not to mention being able to select specific pages out of my document to email. For me it would be a FIVE Star review if I could flatten my documents!"
frustration,Would be awesome!!!!,"Works ok, but pales in comparison to Adobe's usability. Too often this app just loads blank white pages."
frustration,"Works better, less confusing",I downloaded this to my galaxy note 10 and it will not open any pdf documents.  Ican view them but everytime i try to select a document the program shus down. Would prob be a great app ifit worked.t
frustration,I'm not so thrilled!,worked on my nerves
frustration,One Star,"Hi, I bought this app with great expectation, however I was disappointed when opening it because the underlying, highlighting and other features do not work well, I've just updated it, but the is still there... If all the features in this app worked well I think it could be a great app..."
frustration,I couldn't get it to work,"I am a music teacher and I am trying to move all of the written homework from paper to ""on-line"". I read the reviews and PDF Max seemed to be the highest rated PDF annotater for Android.  I tried the free version and I thought that I loved it - lots of bells and whistles.....so I bought it.A few students agreed to do this trial with me so they sent me their homework in PDF format.  I graded it....and then I tried to send it back by email.They could open it but they couldn't see the corrections.  Not on Adobe Reader, or Notability, or any other PDF reader....except the one student who also got PDF Max. HmmmmmmmI contacted the company last Tuesday morning to ask what I was doing wrong.  It is now Monday...no reply.I am sure that there is a way to get it to work, but, with customer service like this, I am not interested in trying.  I have since discovered that I can do EXACTLY what I need to do with FREE Adobe Reader, so I have uninstalled PDF Max.  I hope that you have better luck with it.Update.  It is now December 3, 2015.  Still no reply from the company.  I am now using Foxit.  Free, easy works great!Update #2. It is now January2, 2016.  Still no reply from the company.  By using Foxit, I realized what I was doing wrong and went back to PDF Max Pro to find the ""flatten"" feature. Will update when I have more info....Update #3  It is now January 8, 2016. Still no reply from the company.  What I thought was a problem fixed, turned out to be a bigger problem.  I contacted the company again on January 3. No reply. The ""flatten"" feature is really strange.  It saves a separate copy of the document rather than flattening the current document.  Tried to find the saved ""flattened"" document and it was nowhere to be found.  I have gone back to Foxit.  Foxit works OK and serves the purpose (and it is free).  I really wish Mobeera would reply and help me with the ""flattening"" issue because (other than that) I really like the features on PDF Max Pro..."
frustration,TERRIBLE customer service,Looks like a dead app. Website and support disappeared. It corrupted a document with no apparent way to recover it.
frustration,BAD UPDATE!!!,"It used to be a good app, but now either i can install it no more (this is the case on my galaxy note pro) or it closes as soon as I have opened a pdf (this is the case on my galaxy note 2014). So it is not usable anymore."
frustration,"It used to be a good app, but now either i can install it ...","This app has great potential if only it didn't crash so often,  my hope is the next update will stabilise it because I can see it could be usfull"
frustration,This app has great potential if only it didn't crash so often,"I don't know if $8 is the right price for this, since it don't prints money. But in general the app it's ok."
frustration,App Does Not Perform as Stated,"I am using Amazon HE 8 Tablet 32GB. The application crash every time I try to open a pdf file. I have never got to read one single file. The links to Twitter and Facebook provided by the developer of the app are ""fake"". It is like there is no one supporting this app. It is really unfair!!"
frustration,What happened,"I've just purchased and downloaded this app, but it does not work on my Kindle Fire HD.  I would return it for a refund if there was any way I can see of doing so."
frustration,How do I get a refund on an app that isn't working?,"Read great reviews on Cnet etc about the app though there were some bad reviews on Amazon. Despite that, I bought the app. Installed it and so far each time I try to open a document, the app has closed. It is not an expensive app but I feel cheated that it is totally unworkable and not fit for purpose. I suggest the developers look into this, otherwise there is no future for the app."
frustration,Keep stopping,Crashes when opening.. Waste of money!
frustration,Crashes,"Had been working really well for ages, but now it exits to home screen each time I open a pdf file.Kindle Fire HD 6"
frustration,Won't open my important pdf file,Text
frustration,Keeps crashing.,Difficult to use
frustration,Two Stars,OK nothing special
frustration,Couldn't Use,"Used to be good, but now it won't open anything and crashes every time."
frustration,Crashes all the time now...,Ok but was unnecessary
frustration,False advertising ?,"Dirty trickster! It found my printer and printed a test page just fine. But I should have been alerted to the ""free download"" in the description. It wouldn't let me print anything but the test page without buying the app!"
frustration,Do Not Download.,"Test page would have printed hundreds of pages with one line or one letter.  Had to cancel.Also, a possible bug,  could not find decent driver for HP8610,  and impossible to change selection even after uninstalling and reinstalling app from the cloud.Not a big deal, old Fire is really used,  on iPad we use Airprint, and HP eprint app on androids.6-23-14 Update - Working now with generic driver, pcl 5e, no color but it's good enough. After 3rd reinstall was able to reload printer and driver."
frustration,It works,"Got it to print a pdf from my fire to HP printer. It hooked up fine, but required a paid upgrade to print the pdf.Don’t need it."
frustration,Wonderful.,To print documents
frustration,Great app,Wasn't compatible with my printer
frustration,A Bust!!!,"This appears to be the only source of an app  that will allow me to print from my Amazon Fire 8 Tablet. I tried two HP apps, but they did not have a driver to use with my tablet and printer. I have not yet been able to complete the installation of the Hammermill App for my HP 7520 printer. Too complicated for an old man like me. I need to call someone to talk me through the installation as I cannot even get back to the installation screen. I cannot find a telephone number."
frustration,Easy to use.,Did not work on my Galaxy S10. I deleted it.
frustration,Make your Kindle print!,Wouldn't use my printer!
frustration,Nice and easy,Supposed to work with Kindle fire well it DIDN'T
frustration,Print app,"I can't seem to find any of the printer apps that will work with my Kindle fire gen 10!  I have tried Hammer Print, printbot, print from anywhere, and the Epson app.... None of them work!"
frustration,Not for my Kindle,"Unable to get it to print from any of my android devices.  Difficult to sync my printer with tne app, and ut atill would not work."
frustration,Doesn't work!,Does not load on Amazon HD
frustration,Not for Android?,Never orders this
frustration,?,"Print Hammermill is the first print app I've tried.  I may be expecting too much; something more like printing from a PC. It's nice just to be able to print from my Kindle, but the steps needed to do so are a bit convoluted. I plan to try a couple others."
frustration,Works well with android,"Free version will not wifi print from hp envy  without unless I pay to ""upgrad"""
frustration,Print Hamermill Print app on Kindle Fire - cumbersome,Does not recognize my Dell laser printer
frustration,Wouldn’t print to Lexmark printer,It won’t download
frustration,Doesn't work for a Dell laser printer,Free download
frustration,All!,Hangs
frustration,Great Printer App,fair
frustration,unistall,Never got it to work with my pringer
frustration,Convenient,Program
frustration,Program,Stay away from this app and developer.  Danger Will Robinson!
frustration,If it would work with my Kindle Fire,Did not work with my printer
frustration,Seek out an App that will use all the features your printer has,So did not work with kindal
frustration,Hammer Print,Removed
frustration,Not useable,No print driver for my printer so I went back to go e print.
frustration,Fast,"Would not work with my Canon TS 9020. Paid for another app that also didn't work on my 7"" Kindle fire HDX. Not happy!!"
frustration,Easy,It said I needed to purchase another app for $4.99 in order to print anything and that didn't work either. What a scam!!!
frustration,Don’t download,Worked when first down loaded but within a short time quit working...my be my problem on Kindle not sure.
frustration,Two Stars,Would not work with my kindle fire 10 tablet.
frustration,User friendly,No instuctions
frustration,"Easy, and it works.",Dosen't work
frustration,Very Happy I Got This App,can' connect to computer
frustration,Crap,Found multiple printers
frustration,Five Stars,It does not work.  I can not print anything from this app
frustration,Works,"It seems that this app is not compatible with Kindles. A disappointment, but not the end of the world."
frustration,No to  good  (when downloaded on a smart phone ),Not useful for me and totally unnessary.
frustration,Great for printing from your Kindle.,It seems to work ok but didn't like all of the permissions it has.
frustration,Printer app for Brother HL 2270-DW,Don’t have
frustration,Works Great,"The built in print driver on my Fire HD 8 could not find my old Brother printer. I needed something else and I found this which claimed to support my exact printer. I was not fooled like other reviewers. I knew this app was not free. First I downloaded the free app and ran a print test page. The test page color pattern came out fine. Success! Then I paid for the upgrade to the full version to print real documents. But no matter what I do, it prints only the first page and then stops. I sent email to tech support and asked for help or a refund. Nothing. Not even a reply to say they could not help me.I have seen other reviewers says that it works for them. That is great, but it definitely did not work for me and I got no help from them... not even an acknowledgement. If this is the kind of customer service they offer, all I can say is buyer beware! The test page in the free app does not guarantee that it will print real docs for you...."
frustration,Nice to print fron the tablet,"The App was very easy to set up, after reading several of the blogs that mentioned selecting ""IP.  I've been able to print an attachment to an e-mail, but can't seem to figure out how to actually print e-mail.  I will keep working with the app.  It recognized our network printer without any issue."
frustration,Great App,Don’t use if u want your privacy given away. Their policy says they have access to all your messages contacts and sites u visit.
frustration,Disappointed,This app works with my HP photosmart printer.  But you have to purchase the premium upgrade ( $9.95 ) to print photos and full pages!
frustration,Works on HP print with no problems.,"Maybe it's me, but I could not get the printer to work on my  Amazon Fire 7 tablet. I will give it another try and see what happens."
frustration,Nice Printing App,Didn't work.
frustration,Printer did'nt work for me.,"I used to have this app on a previous generation Kindle. It was free and did a great job. I had to reinstall on this new kindle and it is not free to print, only to download. Very disappointed in the app and in Amazon (which used to have an HP all but no longer does)."
frustration,Five Stars,"works good, except it does not give the option for my XP830 printer. Had to choose another print driver to make it work. I like being able to print from my kindle and smart phone."
frustration,Easy to set up,"Print Hammermill states that the page has been printed when in fact, it does not.  Will be removing this app from my Kindle Fire."
frustration,Works well,"For my purposes it does not work.  It saw all my printer; but as none of them are wireless (network printers) the test sheet did not work.I am thinking if I ran one of them wireless it would, but for a kindle it would not benefit me to do this."
frustration,Good app.,Messed up my printing ability
frustration,Recommend strongly over the Cannon,Boo!
frustration,Now I can print!,They wanted me to pay for something that worked and was dependable. No thanks. I thought we could get this app for free. Never worked without asking for more.
frustration,Great app,"I downloaded this app because my Printer Share app was occasionally buggy. Reviews said that this app was better.Forget it. The only thing that ever printed was the test page. Worthless, not even for free."
frustration,Perfect!!!,"I have a kindle fire HD and could not find a printer app that would work, I even called the tech support and spent over an hour on the phone with no solution, they said there was not one specifically for the kindle fire HD as of yet. This is the only free app that I've found that will work but I have yet to figure out how to print an attachment from an email, it just won't let me do it."
frustration,Five Stars,Can't connect to my HP printer!
frustration,Great app,Took it off as it did not work right for me.
frustration,Five Stars,It didn't work
frustration,Two Stars,Not useful or user friendly.
frustration,SO EASY AND AWESOME!!!,Very disappointed app will work with Kindle fire OS but is very cumbersome. In order to perform a printing task it is like you have to go through the procedure twice. The print options are very limited and 1 major problem it does not allow you to double side your output.Kindle OS really needs to be updated to something simple and useful for a simple task as printing from the device.VERY! VERY! DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON!
frustration,Hammermill,I have a Brother MFC-465CN printer and Hammermill will not allow Kindle to talk directly to that printer. it is compatible with several Brother printers but not mine. However the app installs easily and and discovers your wireless printer effectively. If your printer is on their list of compatible printers it works great.
frustration,not perfect but it does allow you to print emails from ...,"With the Hammermill app i  have not been able to print from my Kindle Fire 8.9 to my HP Officejet 4630 printer. I do have wi-fi, but to print from my computer to my printer i have to use a usb connector."
frustration,Thank You!,not many options to set up printing
frustration,With the Hammermill app i have not been able to ...,"Not working, hassle to do to set up suggested by tech support. It ""sees"" correct printer name, a Kodak wireless. But then connect command says it finds no printer.men. really tired of tech today"
frustration,Works great!,"Having issues printing from my devices, finally removed from my cell! Was able to print one item from my Ipad. I'll keep trying"
frustration,Works for All your Printing Needs!,Before being able to print had to buy an update. Then it bunched everything to one side of paper
frustration,Printer apps,I was trying the print from my Amazon Fire tablet.  Did not work !
frustration,got it to work,"After wasting several hours trying to install this garbage,  iI have no other option than to quit. Thanks for the entertainment in frustration!"
frustration,It works,"TRYING to use with Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; (2012) and HP Laserjet Pro MFP M127 . No joy. I read lots of reviews and tried various suggestions such as downloading  &#34;recommended&#34; rendering software (?) or something, and changing protocol from RAW to IPP. The app tells me that my doc was successfully printed but the printer says it is &#34;printing&#34; and that goes on forever. No doc is ever printed, not from my files or Gmail or anywhere else. I am very disappointed, having spent several hours investigating various apps that are supposed to allow for printing from my device. This one sounded great but failed to deliver!"
frustration,Disappointing,Doesn't work on Kindle Fire 7 HD
frustration,The best I've experienced on my Kindle fire!,Not going to pay for smothing that is and should be free!
frustration,Makes printing from my Kindle very easy.,It wasn't compatible and did not allow me to print.
frustration,Works!,Print Hammermill did not work for me.
frustration,Good product works well recommended when the Epson plug in ...,"Does not work on my android phone. It printed the test sheet just fine, but will not print anything else."
frustration,Four Stars,hello . I want to say that the hammermill app didn't work at all. I try every trick in the book but it wont work. I have a canon printer pixma mg 7100 it did not synchronize.
frustration,does not work on my android phone.,Okay
frustration,Five Stars,will not download - and amazon will not allow me to re-purchase
frustration,This is it!,"I bought a wireless printer from Amazon an HP but it will not work on my kindle fire, my son only paid 59 dollars for an Epson and it works on his kindle fire, very upset"
frustration,How many apps does it take to screw in a light bulb?,"Did not word for the Kindle Fire HD, but I ""bought it on the Kindle itself. must be the wrong app for Kindle fire."
frustration,Not for Kindle fire HD,"It found my printer, but wouldn't print the test page.  Deleted the app."
frustration,It works.,It claims it is a free app until you get printing something it tells you to buy the upgrade for it to work
frustration,Very easy to use,Did not work
frustration,Best Kindle printing app I've found,App would not work
frustration,Very useful,"I had a previous version of this software that stopped working and I was instructed to update. Previous version was free, later version is not free.Free version was easy and efficient.  This keeps dropping out, cant use!"
frustration,Five Stars,Paper selection doesn't work on Epson Workforce 7520. Always prints on 11X17. Gave it three stars because it installed and printed.
frustration,NOT USER FRIENDLY,"Seemed great at first, but then stopped working after first trial. If you have an HP printer -- which I'm sure many do -- the HP free app works fine."
frustration,Meh,Works as they state but I have 1 problem with it.  When printing in duplex it will skip a line and not print it on either side of the sheet
frustration,Great print app,Used to be a great app. Then upgraded. Now you have to pay for update. Not a free app and no longer good. I would rather pay up front for an app than to have surprises while trying to use it.
frustration,Five Stars,Does not work on Canal Pima or Canon laserjet
frustration,"Still New, working great right now",Printed test page
frustration,Satisfied!,"Why does this app need access to my contacts, my call logs, text messages and confidential info? I deleted. I would avoid."
frustration,APP,"Won't work on Blackberry Classic, even though Amazon App store offered it. Crashed after loading repeatedly. I was not able to get to the printing part."
frustration,best printing app for kindle,"This might be a great app, however it does not work with my printers & I really needed to print mytext messages for a legal matter."
frustration,MOBILE PRINTING,Never used still not able to print from Fire 10 any suggestions
frustration,"Lacking instructions to print emails, etc.",Didn't have a printer that managed these.
frustration,Not for everyone!!,Too many steps involved in getting the page to print.
frustration,Two Stars,Didn't work for the printer I'm using.
frustration,GREAT PRINTER APP,It printed but was not even in color. And faded color not good quality.  It will work in a pinch.
frustration,Report abuse,"The only thing 2 things good about this app is: 1) it is free and 2) it sort of works.The 2 major drawbacks to this app which prevents me from giving it at least 4 stars is: it currently does not print in color on an iPad, and 2) It does not have a driver for my HP Laserjet M451dn.  I was able to find a driver that works with a Ubislate 7Ci and the HP to print color but that solution would not work with the iPad."
frustration,Five Stars,"Doesn't work or I can configure it properly. Either way, it's useless to me."
frustration,Free but not worth it.,Still not printing
frustration,it's useless to me,I hesitate to rate anything with only one star. It just failed to work for me. Maybe it worked ok for others.
frustration,EASY,I use it to print patterns.
frustration,Easily understood,"Does not work on KindleHD, tried to contact support but did not get a reply so will just delete the app and start over."
frustration,This a nice app. After I install it I It found ...,Install error every time I try to install.  Kindle Fire HD 6
frustration,Did Not work,"Works well with our Brother 2170W, easy to install and use but no driver for Brother MFC7440N"
frustration,Good system tool,Junk
frustration,Print,Disappointed
frustration,Must buy add on,Have never been able to make it work. Would like to get my money back.
frustration,Waste of time,"Bait and switch ,I'm canceling my Amazon prime for this carp"
frustration,Bait and switch,Hard to print from
frustration,Four Stars,I could never get it to work with my kindle. After downloading it I get the message that a pin nbr would be sent to my email address but I never got it and could not go any farther without it. I went through this 6 or 8 times and still never got the pin number so I gave up.
frustration,this app is excellent,A
frustration,Finally,Nice layout but not compatible with our Epson XP 640  or our ET 3600 model. Too bad. Will check back for updates.
frustration,Print from ypur Kindle,Only works with saved data
frustration,useless,My printer attempts to print then cancels the job.  I don't know why or if anything can be done to correct it.
frustration,Works for me.,Have to purchase a subscription before you can print
frustration,Not worth it,This is a bad app it locks up you have to reload it requires other downloads to function . I strongly believe this app had a virus attached to it which messed up other functions on my Amazon fire .
frustration,Printer app,On an Epson 2450 wireless printer the print density is very light. It has no setting for high quality. I use 110 pound bright paper.
frustration,Not Ready For Prime Time!!!!,I like it.
frustration,Five Stars,Can't find my device. Does not work.
frustration,Two Stars,Did not Print.
frustration,Two Stars,I have tried to download this app numerous times and every time I get an error message. Please fix!
frustration,Print Hammermill.,I was looking for a way to print information off the web using my Kindel Fire HD and I couldn't do it with this program.

frustration,Five Stars,Have not got it to work with my Amazon fire.
frustration,Sick!,Does not work on kindle fire
frustration,Works great for my Brother MFC-J825DW printer,Will not locate my Canon printer.
frustration,It works!!,did not work easily with my spouse's smartphone....may work with it later
frustration,Three Stars,"It sucks, fully understand why it is free does not recognize my cannon mx 922, which is a run of the mill / main stream printer."
frustration,Five Stars,Finds and seems to connect to printers on network.  Have not succeeded to print anything but a smudge yet
frustration,One Star,did not work for Kindle fire HD
frustration,I say this is OK. That is because I ...,It could be a little earlier to.use
frustration,Five Stars,It is not compatible with Epson printers at all. Did not work for me. Uninstalled it. I do not recommend it. Very dissatisfied.
frustration,Five Stars,This is a waste of time. Never could get to work and kept freezing up.
frustration,Doesn't work,Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
frustration,One Star,Difficult to use with Kindle
frustration,Good printing app,Works but could be much better.
frustration,Champ,"Excellent app for Kindle Fire and older iphone 4, however the font from iphone is extremely large whereas from the Kindle it is perfect. Example- an email printed from iphone required 4 pages as to 1 from the Kindle. Cannot find a solution to this,...any help?"
frustration,Doesn't work for me,"First off you need a driver to print to a printer/copier. This app says yeah we can do that and it's free to download. But try to print with it? Oh no, for that (it's only reason for being on my tablet in the first place) you need to upgrade!Just $4.95 and this app will actually send the image to your printer and do what it's intended purpose is.That's like getting tires for free and if you want air in them you need to upgrade for $75 each.Just make the app a purchase item and drop the BS.I would have purchased it if not for the deception."
frustration,One Star,Can't find how to choose color or B/W.
frustration,Love it,Ease of use
frustration,One Star,I like it but it only works on certain websites
frustration,it wont work,didn't work.
frustration,Nice litle program,I really don't know how good or bad this app is as it doesn't have a driver that works with my printer
frustration,One Star,"This app was downloaded  to a phone and two tablets.It printed everything I wanted .While I have  three lasers , they are of two brands, Brother and Pantum.The Brothers worked fine. There was no driver  for the Pantum, so it did not work at all. Hammer mill advised me there was little likelihood of a driver  being  written for this printer.  Which is a shame, because it is great $25 dollar  laser.  Fortunatly, Pantum does  have a mobile app."
frustration,Easy to use and flexible,Can't get it to install on my Kindle fire despite help from Kindles Mayday and the  App store rep..
frustration,Two Stars,Had the Hammer app for a while.  Use on my kindle and phone.  Now what ever I try to print it comes out landscape.  Try everything.  Maybe call Amazon about it.
frustration,oh well,"I hate not being able to print my downloaded documents directly from my Kindle. All I saw on Print Hammermill was lines and lines of numbers and letters, and had to write down the numbers from my documents, because I couldn't remember all that. Then go and searched through all that code for the correct document number. Before, I just went to My Documents on Kindle, selected the one I wanted, selected Print, and boom - done. What was wrong with keeping that, PLUS the app. if that's what someone wanted? Everything gets more and more complicated and more difficult to use. Who sits around all day and thinks of ways to make things more complicated? As an added insult to the public, there are never any instructions available anymore. Not everyone is a techie. Companies need to hire techs who can SIMPLIFY things!"
frustration,Exactly what I was looking for,I couldn't get it to work on my printer. I deleted it
frustration,More headache searching thru code for my docs!,the app wanted to much access to my phone so did not install.
frustration,Five Stars,Did not work with Fire Phone
frustration,One Star,"Is it possible to give this app a less than 1 star rating?  If so, I bequeath it a minus 4 stars!  After much effort I was able to print emails, but if they have attachments you can forget getting that to print! It will not print any pictures on any format, has no tutorial or user's manual and questions sent to the creator of this app go ignored and unanswered.  It is not even worth what you paid for it which was nothing.  I guess the Kindle just isn't meant to print!"
frustration,finally one that works,Does not work for me.  Keeps crashing and does not recognize my printer
frustration,will not installl.....booo,Too hard toLoad and use
frustration,Works! Our computer is kaput & now we are ...,the app printed but it printed really large not the normal size it should.  It has brother printers but not my specific one. Which is Brother HL-2270DW
frustration,It worked ok,This doesn't work on my Kindle either.  Thankfully it's a free app so I'm not upset.
frustration,"Whoops, might be me!",Don't need.
frustration,Great app,OK not very many features.
frustration,Five Stars,No use for my Lexmark printer.
frustration,Not for me,"It took awhile, but once I got it working it was fine."
frustration,Great app,no scan
frustration,Print Hammermill app,Cannot make it work with my Samsung Pro Tab nor Kindle Fire.
frustration,this works !,I purchase this ap it stop working unable to get money back
frustration,Five Stars,Cannot get it to connect to my printer. I can only print thru the cloud. Worked at work but not at home
frustration,Five Stars,"Very good app, but it asks for a driver for my printer  (canon MG 6821)  When I go to the driver list , it does not have one for my  printer.  If your printer driver is listed, it would work very well."
frustration,Work great,Did not work!
frustration,"User friendly, easy and error free!!",It was OK and I don't use it anymore.
frustration,Best app I've tried,would not download to my android.
frustration,Easy to use,This app is full of features but it will not work with my dell so on to the next one
frustration,Better than hp e print app for kindle,boo
frustration,Three Stars,I could not get it to work with my printer.

frustration,Four Stars,Is ok.
frustration,print Hammermill,so so
frustration,Five Stars,Doesn't work with my kindle hd fire and wifi laser printer.  Any suggestions on printer app?
frustration,Not the best for Epson printer,Could not get it to sync with printer.
frustration,Five Stars,I got my tablet to print. But do I need it?
frustration,Four Stars,must have a compatible printer to use on sharing or wifi.Older printers are not capable.
frustration,Five Stars,App wants too much info to use.
frustration,Three Stars,Doesn't work
frustration,very easy to use,I got this app yesterday and won't connect our WiFi canon mx 459 printer. It found WiFi canon mx 450 printer but we don't have model of printer.
frustration,keeps failing - pretty useless,The product doesn't work at all.
frustration,print,"Didn't work, removed it."
frustration,sweet,Not good
frustration,GREAT APP,"The app did not work properly for that reason I can not recomend it, I could't configure the phone to print a good picture."
frustration,Five Stars,Could not find the driver for my Epson 2500 printer.
frustration,Three Stars,Does not work
frustration,One Star,"I am uncertain that it is entirely fair for me to report a lack of success in implementing this product. I am attempting to print from my android devices, but without success. My Brother FAX4100 laser printer is connected by USB to my router and accessed by WiFi by my Windows computers. That arrangement works fine. But the Hammermill app installed on android just does not see the printer at the router's IP address. Drat!"
frustration,Two Stars,Not perfect but does the job.
frustration,great,"Nice app to use when printing from the smart phone.  I wish it had a few more features such as a way to highlight your print area and print just that area so the printout doesn't have all the unwanted garbage at the top and/or bottom.  However, considering that it is a free app it isn't bad.Update:  This app tried to update and for several weeks sat there trying to install.  I tried to uninstall it and it doesn't show up in my app manager.  Still trying to install.  Everyday it tries."
frustration,Working Now,TO MUCH TO GET IT TO WORK DELETED
frustration,Good choice,No comment
frustration,Five Stars,"After reinstalling the app, rebooting wi-fi and the printer, it finally started working on my Canon printer. Nice app that goes with it.UPDATE:  only the test page will print. Nothing from email, contacts, calendar, etc will print. I keep getting errors. Too bad, its a great looking app. I do wonder why I have to pass my password on to Hammermill for every app I choose to print from even though those apps are on my Fire."

I've been using CAD programs since 1985 and this is most chunky unusable piece of crap I've come across.  I down loaded it to my Fire 10 with hopes of using it to put down ideas when I'm away from my computer and found that is was completely useless.  Anybody that's used CAD programs  knows that interruptions are disruptive to thinking and those advertisements do just that besides using valuable space on tiny screens.  Also the description says you can export them to a DXF file but you can't unless pay for an upgrade.  Setting the units and wall thickness to English units is possible but awkward.

On the Fire TV devices it's a horribly useless app where you can only stream seemingly random clips from different shows, but no live streaming. This makes one of the most useful use cases (streaming the live game that is being preempted by a game running late) for TV devices a no-go. It's not like this is a premium paid channel, so blocking from streaming while freely broadcasting makes literally no sense."

frustration,FOX: fix the FF and REV!,"FOX: fix the FF and REV!. App only lets you FF or REW in 10 second increments.  And it must buffer each and every time, which takes a few seconds... So you only jump a few seconds at a time.  You cannot scroll forward or reverse.  You must hit the button over and over again.  EXCRUCIATING!  Also, if you hit the BACK button by mistake, you go back to menu and you MUST start the broadcast from the beginning!  No RESUME at the spot you left, you must not skip forward in 5 seconds increments, over and over and over and over.  Come on FOX, this is totally unacceptable.  A sophomoric attempt at a streaming app."
frustration,Just want to see the Cowboys games!!!!,"Just want to see the Cowboys games!!!!. Downloaded this app in hopes of watching the Dallas Cowboys game.  It’s frustrating but understandable games are regionally broadcast.  Since NC has the Panthers now, we have lost viewing of the Cowboys except on special occasions.  I’m not willing to pay $400+ to watch the Cowboys.  It seems with all streaming options available today and the NFL ticket being the only option.....any streaming service could increase sales by offering an a la carte option to fans wanting to see only their teams play!  Somebody solve this issue!!!!!"
frustration,Used to love this app. Now it's worthless.,"Used to love this app. Now it's worthless.. New update to both fox apps have caused the error ""no internet connection"".All other apps work.If I let it sit I can hear live streaming audio playing in the background.A reinstall did not fix the problem.A reset of the fire stick did not fix the problem."
frustration,How did you screw up this badly?,How did you screw up this badly?. Have fire stick and received an update for Fox Sports Go. Updated and now there is no longer a Fox Sports Go app but Fox Sports and IT DOESN'T WORK!!!!!  Chatted with an agent who said to uninstall and reinstall and then promptly got off ASAP.  Of course that did not work.  So disappointed. What now?  Where do you get help?  Who do you talk to?
frustration,"Buggy, kept freezing and resetting to beginning during commercial breaks.","Buggy, kept freezing and resetting to beginning during commercial breaks.. Attempted to use during 1 hour free trial, and found it virtually impossible to use. Didn't like us trying to fast forward and was unstable when we did. Every time we hit the first block of commercials, the app froze during one of the commercials (not the same one each time). Tried for 20 minutes to get past this roadblock (to see the start of the archived event we were trying to watch), finally just gave up. We were using a FireStick to stream on our TV. Problem wasn't internet connection (we tested the speed)."
frustration,TOTALLY USELESS without cable subscription,"TOTALLY USELESS without cable subscription. I was intrigued when I installed the app and it let me watch live sports without logging in with a provider. Then it stopped 12 hours later after the preview period ended. Now it won't let me watch ANYTHING without a cable subscription.As a cord NEVER (I have never had cable so I am not technically a ""cord cutter"") this app is COMPLETELY and TOTALLY USELESS to me. Why not let me PAY YOU MONEY DIRECTLY with a subscription so I can watch your content? Why are you turning away money? Your incremental costs are negligible."
frustration,Waste of time and effort,Waste of time and effort. I got this because where I live I do not have access to cable and satellite is too expensive.  I do however have high speed internet through a program with ATT.  it is their home phone with added internet.  This internet is only available to rural households that do not have access to cable.  I only get 50 gigs but it is enough for now.Anyway once app is installed you get about 5 minutes preview then you have to sign up....No problem I thought...Wrong.  When you sign up you have to sign in with your cable tv provider.  That is ridiculous.  If I had a cable tv provider I would have Fox and not need this app...  what the hell is the purpose
frustration,HORRIBLE APP: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,"HORRIBLE APP: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Downloaded the app to watch the WORLD CUP and it was just HORRIBLE! The quality isn’t great, the screen freezes every 5 seconds. It was such a waste time going through the process of downloading the app as I had to go back to my regular HDMI TV to watch World Cup. Plus, I missed a portion of the game to download the app!! Horrible!! FOX SPORTS GO please do something about this immediately!"
frustration,Could not find a Guide,Could not find a Guide. There is not a Guide to inform you where to look for what you are wanting to watch.  We thought that our Seahawks game would be on this station as DirecTv has discontinued the Fox Network.  But could find the game.  Maybe an explanation of what is included in the subscription would be wise for other viewers.
frustration,Needs lots of work.,Needs lots of work.. Spotty service. Lagging picture and motion. Lots of dead spots. And this is with a high speed internet connection.
frustration,Fox sports app is useless.,"Fox sports app is useless.. I went to watch the race on FS1 today. When I go to the Fox Sports app I've been using for months it takes me to a new app that I need to download, but there is no way to download the new app. This is useless, and NASCAR wonders why their viewers have declined. I know I won't be watching any sports on any Fox channel. I'm done with them."
frustration,Audio/video lag makes frustrating viewing,"Audio/video lag makes frustrating viewing. When first opening the app, it takes a while for the videos to start up. Once a video is playing, specifically the live videos, there is a lag between the audio and video. The audio is about 3 seconds ahead of the video. This makes it very frustrating to watch because you hear fans cheering or announcers saying something and you can’t even see what they are talking about until 3ish seconds later. I have had no issues with any other live video steaming on the fire stick, and have not had an issues with Fox Sports Go on any other streaming device."
frustration,Registration failure,"Registration failure. Registering with my cable company via Fox Activate url and Fox provided code did not work after repeated attempts. Have not reached out via Support ticket yet, but will do so soon. Once resolved, will adjust rating."
frustration,Research thoroughly before you buy,Research thoroughly before you buy. I downloaded to watch the nascar race on Sunday. I was not able to use it because I do not have a tv provider. I have a digital antenna and this will not work with it. It doesn’t work with the fire stick either unless you have a tv provider. 😡😡
frustration,Difficult to use,Difficult to use. Tried to watch NFL game. Very hard to get signed in and contact with the actual game. After one hour a notice saying trial was over and please sign in for further viewing. That turned out to be impossible. App was good for one free hour of football.

frustration,Error Code 403-PA1000,"Error Code 403-PA1000. I tried to watch the Boise State game on 11-12-20, got this error message. ""Subscription has limited access to our content""! Could no find how fix this problem or if the problem is fixable."
frustration,All streaming channel apps?,All streaming channel apps?. Is it just me or are all streaming apps by individual channels just annoying? I want a central place to watch stuff like my Comcast box offers. Maybe I'm just being old and grumpy!
frustration,Could be better,"Could be better. The stream would cut in & out randomly, sometimes it just stopped showing a still picture for up to 10 to 30 seconds during the hight of the Deltona 500 race. Upsetting at times!"
frustration,Still couldn’t stream the game,"Still couldn’t stream the game. Still can’t watch what’s available from my TV provider. I assumed that because with my AT&T TV package at home I get a specific game (Braves/Dodgers game 5), that downloading this and logging in with my provider would let me stream it while traveling. Not the case. Annoying and confusing. Never was able to stream the game."
frustration,"Not worth it, couldnt even use half the functions. Worthless","Not worth it, couldnt even use half the functions. Worthless. I got the app after finding out that BTN was not a separate app on fire TV. So, after downloading,  every thing I clicked on was slow loading or unavailable.  I got so annoyed,  i just went back to the  ESPN app and watched what I wanted."
frustration,FOXSPORTS app DOSE NOT WORK,"FOXSPORTS app DOSE NOT WORK. This is the worst app I have used.I had to clear the cache and data and uninstall the app and do a soft rest of my TV just to get this app to work for live event.I get an error every time I try to watch any replays or highlights using this app.If the women's World Cup viewing numbers are low, it is because this app does not work."
frustration,No Help,"No Help. I am still unable to activate this even after speaking with four chat helpers, four different phone calls to Fox, Firefox, amazon and prime. If I don't get resolution I am going to cancel all my subscriptions to Amazon and others. I have spent three days trying to get this resolved and all I get are ""canned responses"" by e-mail, which I followed numerous times to no avail. If you are going to help, then do it, don't just say you are always available to help."
frustration,BTN requires Fox which requires provider,BTN requires Fox which requires provider. I signed up with BTN+. They do not provide direct video of an active game. Instead I should use FOX SPORTS app. That app would not allow me to use it without a paid provider from their list. BTN  Was not there. So I could not use their app
frustration,also worthless,"also worthless. You can only watch NFL football on this if you already have cable or satellite TV. If you do, then what's the point of this application?"
frustration,Can’t sign in,Can’t sign in. Useless

frustration,Low volume issues,"Low volume issues. Occasionally will not load-gets stuck on ""warming up"" screen- and requires an uninstall/reinstall when this happens.  Biggest issue is the low volume.  All other streaming apps on this device have no volume issues but this app is very low..until a commercial comes on.  Commercials are way louder than any game I've watched on this app."
frustration,Frustrated,Frustrated. Can’t get it to work.  It keeps wanting me to sign in thru the fire stick to my tv provider which is Amazon.  There is no Amazon listed in the selection on the fox sports  website.  Have never had this issue with any of the other fire stick apps.  Hmmm
frustration,Could not watch game due to provider schedule,Could not watch game due to provider schedule. I downloaded to watch baseball game as Hulu does not show entire game is extends past a certain time.  But I had to use Hulu account and thus Hulu channel schedule was showing poker and thus the game was no longer available.  So I can only give 3 stars even though the app is pretty good.
frustration,Fix this Update,Fix this Update. Update on May 13 is horrible.  Before this update i was able to watch Fox Sports Go on my Kindle. Now the app redirects me to Fox website which needs so much buffering. Awful update that renders this app useless to me.
frustration,poor image quality w lots of skips,"poor image quality w lots of skips. poor image quality w lots of skips, occasional slo-mo streaming. Thought poor image quality may be my wifi signal, but a Netflix flick immediately after streamed smoothly. Also hard to figure out how to get rid of CC, which was on by default and greatly annoying for being 10s ahead of the video, but eventually found the right button to shut off on the Amzn remote."
frustration,Never connected,Never connected. Worthless unless you have a cable connection. DSL providers are either not listed or refuse service when you attempt to connect. Wasted two hours trying everything suggested to access.
frustration,"Well that was useless, since we already have FoxSports1 throught Direct TV","Well that was useless, since we already have FoxSports1 throught Direct TV. We were trying to figure out a way to disconnect from Satelitte TV and thought this app would help through our Amazon Firestick.  However, after we downloaded the app, you still have to provide a TV provider in order to use.  Well that was useless, since we already have FoxSports1 throught Direct TV."

Same ""no internet connection issue"" as noted by others.  Please fix this!Is Amazon and Fox completely ignorant and stupid to ignore so many users!This app simply does not work on Firetv 4k and I am assuming all the other fire platforms.  This is crap, fix already!  Amazon are you listening?  Fox are you listening?  About ready to give up on all of it.  So frustrating."

frustration,WTF,"WTF. I have no idea what they have done with the app, but i can no longer watch anything on it.  It constantly freezes and I cannot watch the baseball game at all.  I try to log out and go back in but it still freezes every 5 seconds.

frustration,"Glitchy quality, unable to rewind/fast forward","Glitchy quality, unable to rewind/fast forward. I just got a new fire tv cube and this app runs far worse on it than it does natively on my roku smart TV.

frustration,FOX hates cord-cutters,"FOX hates cord-cutters. Does not include FOX, missed Steelers game live. Also, FOX keeps dropping out of streaming channels."
frustration,PPV is Terrible Don't Buy,PPV is Terrible Don't Buy.

frustration,Worst app ever!,Worst app ever!. The app constantly says no network connection then you hit retry and it loads in then says the same thing. Obviously I have an active network connect or else I wouldn’t be able to stream using any of the apps on my fire stick
frustration,Freezes on Fire TV,"Freezes on Fire TV. I have 50 Mbs Internet. I can stream Fox Sports Go fine on my computer. However, it freezes constantly on Fire TV. It freezes so much that I can exit a game and go back to the game and be off by 5 minutes of game time."
frustration,I wish there were a no star option,"I wish there were a no star option. I got this to watch the women's soccer finals. Every 5 minutes I had to re-sign in to my ""free trial."" Terribly pixelated. It was like a 1980's PacMan screen. HORRIBLE."

frustration,Useless to watch anything that isn't live,"Useless to watch anything that isn't live. Can only time jump 10 seconds at a time. This makes the app basically useless for watching anything that has a pre show or anything like that.

Terrible app and service.  The only one I have ever experienced that was worse was SlingTV.  Both buffer constantly, freeze, and require reboots often.  I ordered this to watch NBC Sports Network so I was seeing all the 2018 Winter Olympics.  Don't count on watching your favorite competition without lots of interruptions.  I literally couldn't watch a single Luge run (all under one minute runs) without it buffering at least once if not more often.That's truly pathetic.  We have a stable and speedy connection and have no issues with amazon prime, netflix, youtube, and a myriad of other streaming types of content.If you're looking for a streaming service app, this one is a real drag.  Don't subscribe to these folks...  Run, don't walk away..."
frustration,Cable company like channel bundling and laughable DVR concept,"Cable company like channel bundling and laughable DVR concept. Everybody hates cable companies and their practice of forcing customer to pay for bundles of channels just to get one or two that they really want. Now with fuboTV it seems they are trying to extend that practice to online streaming. All I want is the cycling channel but fuboTV requires me to signup up for their fuboPremier bundle (at $34.99/month) just to be able to add cycling channel (another $8.99/month). You'd think that with a demise of cable industry they would have learned their lesson.Second, their concept of ""DVR"" is laughable. With all the past shows stored on their servers (in the ""cloud"") - why is it that I need to actually mark future shows to record? Why can't I just go and watch any past episode that I missed? What is it, year 1998? Seems like another attempt by cable companies to screw up their customer and make it as hard as possible to get what I want."
frustration,Useless. I bought it because I wanted to watch ...,Useless. I bought it because I wanted to watch .... Useless. I bought it because I wanted to watch an important soccer game for World Cup qualifiers. It crashed down and could not see even any channel at all. It kept saying that I didn't have network and yet my other apps like Sling or Amazon were fine. I understand that this happen to many people too. First Bad impressions are difficult to forget.
frustration,Lagging compared to other devices that are streaming with Fubo,"Lagging compared to other devices that are streaming with Fubo. The fubo TV app as a whole is the same across devices, I have it on iphone and ipad and the experience is the same. However, the fubo TV app on the fire stick lags about 20-25 seconds compared to having the same stream on iphone or ipad. Considering that the iphone/ipad are 10-15 secs behind a TV provider like spectrum, it makes it hard to view live sports so far behind. I am okay with 10-15 seconds behind but not 35-40 secs behind. If the Fubo guys can fix this and make all devices have the stream at the same time it would be awesome. For now, I am still using the lighting to hdmi converter and using my ipad to view fuboTV on the big screen."
frustration,There's a Sneaky Catch to This Service.,"There's a Sneaky Catch to This Service.. I think FuboTv is a very good service that provides great channels, including MSG so I can watch my Devils lose mercilessly every other day, BUT!!!!! Beware, there's a sneaky stipulation to their service.  You are unable to stream FuboTV on 2 devices at the same time if you are on 2 different wifi networks.  Example: my sister has a house and I have a house.  The home network is my house, therefore if she wants to watch fubo on a roku/firestick/ smart tv app/ apple tv / xbox at her house while im watching it at my house it is not allowed. This rule only applies to TV Devices.  So in that case she or I would need to stop using the firestick to watch fubo and start watching on our phones or laptops.  Extremely inconvenient for people using the same account in 2 different homes.  I spoke to fubo about it and they said there's nothing they can do and it's part of their contract.They need to make it so that we can pay maybe like $5 extra per month to add a TV Device outside of the home network cuz this is going to make me cancel their service."
frustration,Do not waste your time,Do not waste your time. I gave it a 1 so I could write the review. I have tried two other streaming services and had minimal issues. This is by far the worst thing I have ever tried. Couldn't watch at all. Over a 2 day period nothing would play.
frustration,Very Difficult to Cancel,"Very Difficult to Cancel. I didn't sign up for a ""Free Trial"", but somehow it appeared in my Amazon account. Amazon couldn't help me stop the free trial, and it was like pulling teeth to deal with Fubo, although the reps were trying. It's expensive per month as far as I'm concerned (not a sports fan) and I was concerned they would start charging me after the Free Trial. My rating is based only on my frustrating experience and not on the quality of the streaming or content."
frustration,Terrible website terrible service,Terrible website terrible service. They already charged me and was watching a game and 15 minutes later I was disconnected and couldn't get back in. My internet connection is excellent. The Fubo website kept stating to try again later. I gave up. I want to unsubscribe.
frustration,Terrible,"Terrible. Didn't get past the 1st day.  Froze (without exaggeration) every 30 seconds. Such a shame because it was very user friendly, had all the channels we wanted and was affordable but the constant buffering made watching any show impossible."
frustration,Has some little annoyances,"Has some little annoyances. Like a strange little 5 second repeat that makes you feel like there’s a glitch in the matrix.  It also will just randomly stop in the middle of a show and say it can’t play the requested video at the moment...try again later.  I have a brand new Samsung, unlimited internet and none of our other streaming services have these odd occurrences.  Also, I wish it had more 4K programming.  After football season’s over, we’ll need to reassess."
frustration,I'm ditching FuboTv and going to Hulu January 2020,I'm ditching FuboTv and going to Hulu January 2020. Both of my subscriptions were just pre-paid for January but I'm getting rid of Fubo on January 24. The product was ok but had issues with subscriptions from day one. I held on for five months now but am sick and tired of when they update their software that I have to go through and reactivate most of the channels that are included. My current configuration is Firestick TV 4K with Fubo and Sling Orange for ESPN. I should have dropped both of these in September and stuck with Hulu only. I have had multiple FuboTv issues with my subscription especially Showtime and wasn't able to receive or activate multiple channels for weeks. FuboTv SOFTWARE IS BROKEN and desperately needs to be fix.
frustration,Refund Difficult,"Refund Difficult. Poor picture,,,,constant streaming delays...looking for way out of my free tria. and it appears...as usual to be ""obscured"" and hard to do.  OMG.  It is the standard ""free trial"" trap!  I finally figure out where the opt out was....so I raised the review to 3 stars.  The only other issue I have is price.  I can add the channels on cable/satellite (that I want to watch) for the same price or less.  Value is not there."
frustration,Fine if you don't have cable,"Fine if you don't have cable. A long way to go before I cut my cable.  Very clutsy interface and not user friendly.  Had lots of pixilation and drop in picture quality.  Support is poor.  NO ABC so my wife hated it.  Some of the games I wanted to watch were not available but I could stream them on my iPad.  Cloud service is basic and problematic -- can't fast forward while recording in session, cant programs until they are scheduled.Thought I hated my cable until this!"
frustration,FuBarTV,"FuBarTV. Does not work 95% of the time. If you would like to watch this on your firetv stick, understand that under peak load this app will not even start. When this app does work (games no one is interested in) expect lag, poor image quality, and tearing. Autogoooool. Stop wasting our time FuBaRTV."
frustration,"Terrible reliability, worse customer support","Terrible reliability, worse customer support. The product has potential. It has the channels except for Turner channels. But, it you watch a highly watched sports event Fubo doesn’t have the bandwidth to deliver. You will get several “we’re having technical difficulties” messages interrupting the game. If you call customer service it’s an hour on hold to get a person who knows less than the customer. If you email they get back to you in a week. I had to delete and reinstall the app daily for six weeks before giving up. I was running Fubo on a 2020 Nvidia Shield Pro, the fastest streaming device available."

Sling doesn't do this on the same internet connection, Direct TV doesn't do this either. Also, the DVR just doesn't work. I couldn't watch a single match."
frustration,Buffering issues,"Buffering issues. Interface is great. easy to use but im having some buffering issues. i dont have this type of problem with other steaming services like netflix, hulu, etc but i guess maybe the difference is this is live TV? it was terrible while watching the superbowl. my kids are getting frustrated also while watching their shows Nick jr, etc. likely going to cancel."
frustration,So very frustrating!,"So very frustrating!. I was unable to set up app via Fire TV, so I went online to set up and tried to log in.  I can not get past the initial page explaining charges.  It simply spins and says signing in.  I was eager to use this to catch international matches, but I guess I will have to go to other sources"
frustration,Constantly loses signal.,"Constantly loses signal.. Paying $44 a month for fubo is ridiculous. It plays the selected channel for about 1 minute before it loses signal and I have to exit out to the main screen and reload the selected channel. I shouldn’t have to do that with amount of money I’m paying. It makes no sense that when it loses signal, it will not regain it again unless I reload the channel. I know it’s not my internet because I don’t have problems with any other devices. Very unhappy."
frustration,Don't waste your time,Don't waste your time. I would have given zero stars if that was an option. Everything was in Spanish and I couldn't figure out how to switch it to English. I called the customer service number (which is automated) and it said it couldn't find my account. I cancelled it within 30 minutes of starting. Save yourself the headache. Don't waste your time. There are plenty of other options that work.
frustration,has buffering issues,"has buffering issues. Tried watching sports, hgtv and a movie. In each case, one of two things would happen every 5-10 minutes1. video freezes while audio continues, then video ""jumps"" to the current location of the audio. You miss several seconds of video2. video and audio repeat the last several seconds of what you watched. So, as you're watching a show, suddenly you're rewatching the last 5 seconds or so. It happens quite oftenNB: have a dedicated 60 mpbs internet line; watching via FireTV Stick, located about 3 feet from the router. No other devices consuming wifi or internet at the time.I've since read that this is an issue with FuboTV. I don't experience these problems with Netflix, Prime video, Hulu, Youtube or when casting from a mobile deviceThat being said, the interface is horrible. I preferred my MediaOne (or whatever it was in those days) cable interface in the 90's to this. No search capability at all. Can't continue to watch a show while scrolling for another. No last channel or favorites concepts. So, in 2 days, prior to the end of the trial, I'll switch to Sling and compare."
frustration,Product Sucks,"Product Sucks. Never could get the service working. downloaded app, then setting it up it wouldn't take my credit cards.. now I can't delete it. Sick of these BS apps and setups"
frustration,NOOOO!!!,NOOOO!!!. We never could get it downloaded.  Hopefully I have cancelled this app.  It's impossible to know.  There's no place to send and email to cancel the 7 day free-trial.  I intend to fight it if they charge me.
frustration,Did not like the user interface,"Did not like the user interface. Very annoying to watch part of a movie and then to come back later and not have that movie resume at the point you stopped.  Happened more than one and the forward feature was ""unavailable"".  Not my cup of tea."
frustration,Couldn’t watch,Couldn’t watch. This app is lame. We wanted to watch the World Cup. We click on this app and it requires you to go online and enter a code. I was using our TV thru amazon fire and didn’t want to mess with getting out my laptop. I hate apps / shows that advertise on amazon fire but you really can’t watch them - it’s frustrating
frustration,I can't get it to work,"I can't get it to work. It keeps asking me to sign in, does not, will not recognize any email I provide. Will not allow me to set up an acct. Useless app as far as I am concerned. Going to uninstall it."

Was consider changing from Hulu since price was going up but and this offered NFL.  Picture had a slight lag and Fubo stopped showing the game when there was 5 minutes left at the end!  Tried to go back and Fubos app said game had ended and it hadn’t!  If that’s the way they air, I dint want it -so cancelled!!!"
frustration,Nice pic lousy DVR,"Nice pic lousy DVR. The picture quality is great but the cloud recording did not show where you are. Also, the channels are difficult to get to. Finally, loading on my phone killed all streaming video. Not sure why."
frustration,Poor Signal Constant Scolling :-(,Poor Signal Constant Scolling :-(. Poor streaming signal quality.  I have Netflix and Amazon Prime movies and have no problems viewing movies without weak signal scrolling.  With FuboTV movies and recordings I find that viewings are constantly being interrupted by a weak signal and constant scrolling.  Not happy at all.  I'm thinking of terminating my service.
frustration,No search function,"No search function. The app over all works pretty good. However, there seems to be no search function anywhere, at least no where I have found. It is pretty annoying when I am trying to find a specific show and have to go scrolling through hundreds of other shows just to find mine. There is a search function on the iOS app why not on this one?"
frustration,Not worth the hassle or the price,Not worth the hassle or the price. So frustrating to set up - worse than similar products. And ultimately didn’t have what we wanted to watch (football game)

If not working after one day I will cancel my Fubo.TV."
frustration,Fubo TV could have been great,"Fubo TV could have been great. Fubo would have been great but they don’t allow you to stream from different WiFi locations without interrupting your stream. So if I wanted to watch my football game at a friends house and login with my password, it will play, but an alert will pop up every minute or so and you have to click to continue which interrupts the other stream watching at home. It’s very annoying. Canceling it in a few days."
frustration,"Good idea, stream is lousy at times.","Good idea, stream is lousy at times.. Hi,Got this for Il Giro. The picture streaming is lousy at times and locks up.

frustration,Live stream kept buffering.,Live stream kept buffering.. Purchased to watch an out of region game on NBA TV. The game was blocked out on PS Vue. Great that we were able to get the game but the stream buffered every 30 seconds. Very annoying. My internet is 100mb down on fiber. My device was hard wired.

When I tried to get help there was no place to email or contact  the website just kept directing me to their help site. They had a phone number you could call but it kept rolling over and making me choose an option every five minutes. Needless to say, I chose this app to see a football game, and I started one hour early to do so,  and I never got to see any of the game. I don’t even know who to contact to get out of my trial period.Horrible horrible customer service. I will be surprised if anyone actually subscribes to this service."

I am in a different state and wanted to watch the pre-season game for my home football team that happened to be playing the team for the state I was visiting.  It picked-up on my location and wouldn't let me watch due to blackout rules for the location where I was. Waste of my time.
frustration,Misleading advertising,Misleading advertising. I did not want to pay for an additional TV service. I was searching for a way to view NBC which was deled from my current cable provider.  I never downloaded this app for the 7-day free trial.  I cannot locate the option to cancel. It is advertised that you may cancel at any time but how?  I deleted this app but received a receipt for the purchase in the amount of $.00 via email.  I fear my credit card will be automatically charged after 7 days even though I did not download the app. It should not be this difficult to cancel.  DO NOT review this app.  This is a nightmare!!

frustration,It's just a useless to have and I can't see it,"It's just a useless to have and I can't see it. The only way I can write a review is by picking at least one star, which it doesn't deserve.  Not by fault of the app, but to Amazon. The reason I don't have cable is because of the high prices, but yet Amazon requires you to sign in a cable/satellite user provider.  If anything, you should be allowed to use you internet sign on to access any app you have listed.  It's just a useless to have and I can't see it.  Get with the program Amazon."

frustration,Only works in the USA - No Good for TRAVELERS -,"Only works in the USA - No Good for TRAVELERS -. Lame as hell. Thanks for telling the users clearly before installing that this will not work outside the USA. I travel 1-200,000 miles a year so while in Europe I am stuck with Eurosport. Now if I was in the USA, then maybe the NBC app would be great. But please,  don't hide the truth. ""internet connection error"" is a lie. My internet in Europe is 1ms ping & 700mb dl/200mb up.  ""This app only works within the United States"" is just a little more clear. The pages all show up, thumbnails in place, but nothing plays. Very frustrating until some searches reveal your dirty laundry."
frustration,Not worth the effort,"Not worth the effort. Olympic coverage is constantly buffering, even during the commercials. And when content is playing, half the time the screen is so blurry it's practically unwatchable. All of these problems occur even though I have average speeds of ~150Mbps, so the bandwidth problem is on NBC's end. Additionally, the app interface is repetitive and difficult to navigate to the content I want to actually see."
frustration,Useless app,"Useless app. This app is virtually useless unless you pay for cable or satellite TV service. And if you do then what are you doing trying to watch it on Amazon for? All apps that require paid TV service should be band from the App Store. The reason you bought the Amazon Fire stick in the first place was so that you wouldn't have to pay for TV service. And if you do pay for service you'd be watching that service, not trying to get it on the fire stick."
frustration,Glitchy,"Glitchy. I very much like that I can stream Sunday night football... but it is SO glitchy!  Often throughout programming, it buffers and repeats what has already been played - which in and of itself is annoying but then when this happens a few times, the lag between what is being watched and real time is considerable. When they figure out how to fix this, I think it’ll be a decent app."
frustration,waste...,"waste.... If you don't have cable, or your cable subscription doesn't include NBCSN, you can't stream content from NBCSN  on this app. If you have cable, you probably have a cable-company app on your device, so you don't need this anyway."
frustration,Worst app ever?,"Worst app ever?. I only use this to catch up on F1 racing. I have to go through the process of re-registering my devices (roku and Apple TV) just about every week. This means going on the internet, entering the unique code and waiting...waiting...waiting for the app to unlock itself AGAIN. Super annoying!"
frustration,Pixelated POS,"Pixelated POS. Absolute waste of money. We pay for the NBC Sports Gold so we can watch bike and track (and the olympics). The app never retains our filters or preferred settings. Volume doesn’t stay constant when switching to commercials - oh yeah, commercials! The same ones over and over and over... The app will randomly crash on occasion (at the worst moments!! And then you have to start the video all over again) and is pixelated (not an internet issue, all other apps/streaming work fine). Very frustrating."
frustration,App is extremely limited vs browser version,"App is extremely limited vs browser version. A sporting event I am watching through my computer browser on the NBC Sports stream site shows as unavailable on the app. For some reason, the app doesn't show anything that's not on your local NBC channel. I'm trying to watch a nationally televised game, but my local NBC channel is showing a local game instead. Skip the app and use the browser, but only if you must. If you can watch the event on ANY other platform than NBC, use that instead."
frustration,poor design,"poor design. if i am watching nbcSn and Premier League Live is on.  When a soccer match starts on nbcSn (the same channel) a screen pops up saying ""coverage has concluded"" and it has...on Premier League Live...but i didnt change channels...it should just continue on with coverage of the damn channel.  Instead, i have to walk by the TV see that coverage has concluded and by the time i go back to the menu and find the match i want to watch...ive missed 15 minutes.  Its just a poor design."
frustration,useless!!,useless!!. wanted to see my UK soccer matches.couldNOT interface at all.No proper instructions could be found!!will cancel
frustration,Time frame,"Time frame. I was frustrated,  I was trying to watch the nfl game( Sunday night) but I could only watch it for 35 minutes.The screen has a time clockTicking down.Can someone please tell me why I couldn't watch the entire game 🤨"
frustration,Not worth the trouble,"Not worth the trouble. Many technical difficulties getting it setup for events stayed we could watch at no charge.  Once setup and select the event we wanted, app stated game was not available in our area.  Deleted and got a different sports app.  Not worth the aggravation!"
frustration,Streaming needs a lot of work,"Streaming needs a lot of work. absolutely abysmal streaming experience, granted it was the superbowl, however one would think NBC sports would be prepared.The delays were 3-6 minutes, occasionally longer, and there was a buffering every 45 seconds.Read that again...every...45...seconds...Astonishingly poor experience"
frustration,Worthless,"Worthless. I have Time Warner for basic channels, but don't want to pay a ton for channels I won't need.  Turns out, since I don't subscribe to the package that includes a bunch of garbage channels that also includes NBC Sports, I can't use this app. I know it's a CYA for the providers so they can keep people attached to cable, but I'm just going to cancel it all and get one of these small internet only providers for a quarter of the price if I can't watch on here. Look at all the add revenue they're missing on the Olympics by blocking anyone without a higher tier sports package."
frustration,"You want to stand alone, cut the cord. Baaaah sheep","You want to stand alone, cut the cord. Baaaah sheep. Need to make this stand alone and cut the cable bill. This is the way of The future. This app is useless without your cable provider so it’s just useless."
frustration,Free preview time limits,"Free preview time limits. I wanted to see if I could get the Sunday night NFL game.  I can never get NBC on the airwaves in Orlando, FL.  No problem with the other networks.  You get 45 minutes free, but if you log out, the timer keeps going, which SUCKS!!"
frustration,Didn't work for me,"Didn't work for me. I'm not sure whether it was my internet connection or the NBC Sports feed, but the Super Bowl was buffering so badly that it was 10 to 15 minutes behind over-the-air broadcast before halftime.  I eventually gave up and watched the game on an older TV with an indoor over-the-air antenna."

frustration,Hard to use.  Terrible U.I.,Hard to use.  Terrible U.I.. The system is hard to use.  It should not be.  Its difficult to find what you want and then figuring out how/when to watch it.
frustration,Not useful to watch sports on.  Very frustrating.,"Not useful to watch sports on.  Very frustrating.. Very inconsistent and frustrating to watch sports on.  Videos regularly don't load or hang midway through.  Also requires payment to, in theory, watch a limited selection of heavily curated videos."
frustration,Didn’t work well on our lg smart tv,"Didn’t work well on our lg smart tv. It would only play for a short period of time on my smart tv and then it threw me out claiming I had to go through my tv provider. We stream everything and the provider for the internet said they couldn’t provide that. The commercials were only dead air, no countdown, nothing. The forward & reverse did not work for the Olympics. It was way too annoying to deal with."
frustration,Buffering issue,"Buffering issue. Watched the nascar race yesterday using my amazon fire stick. Not sure if the constant buffering was nbc, or the device, but I saw the race..."
frustration,Can't seem to broadcast during peak times.,"Can't seem to broadcast during peak times.. I'm sure other times this isn't as big a deal, but during the 2018 Super Bowl LII all I got from running the app was a generic error.  Never got it to come up and had to switch to something else to get the game going.  Not impressive for a company whose entire business is broadcasting.  If they didn't know how to do this on the internet, they should have just worked with something like Twitch."
frustration,Can't use this app without a cable or satellite TV subscription,"Can't use this app without a cable or satellite TV subscription. NBC needs to get with the program and allow people to pay a monthly fee to subscribe to their app without having to also have a paid television subscription.  Everyone is cutting the cord - we only want to buy what we want to see, and not everything else that is offered."
frustration,Awful,Awful. I am a Notre Dame fan and love Sunday night football and this app is not remotely good for streaming. I would say that about every five minutes it does the circle of death during the stream. None of the other sports apps do this. I have no problems with the Fox Sports app or WatchESPN. I don't know how this app has so many problems with the large amount of people that will stream games off of this app.
frustration,Poorly Optimized,"Poorly Optimized. Not optimized, allowed me to watch a hockey game that was not local whatsoever, but when I tried to watch the Pittsburgh Penguins play the Philadelphia Flyers it said I was out the region. Odd since I live in Pennsylvania where both teams are from..."

What happened to me last night is a .... this app is just plain horrible.  What happened to me last night is a regular occurrence for anything I watch.Rangers vs. Sabers hockey game.  Great, I'm from ny but live out of the area.  The app continuously buffers every 10 minutes for a period of 5-10 minutes.  It usually continues where it left off, however it will also catch up and poof end of the game, or missed goal.This happens all the time."
frustration,I gave one star because I had to to for ...,I gave one star because I had to to for .... I gave one star because I had to to for the review! I have the fire stick which has been too up to this point.  I downloaded this app on my tv. It only works if you have a television service. What the heck!! If I had a tv service why would i need this app?!!  Very frustrating
frustration,Pretty much useless and support is virtually non existent,Pretty much useless and support is virtually non existent. Will not play anything except short clips.  Attempted to get assistance from NBC and they said to delete and reinstall the app.  Did that and still can't watch a full event.  Pretty much useless and support is virtually non existent.
frustration,That sucks big time,"That sucks big time. I can't get into any NBC sports shows because I don't have a TV provider.  That sucks big time.  I really wanted to see the winter olympics. I'm actually getting sick of this same thing happening to most apps I download for free.  Why would I want to get onto the apps thru amazon firestick tv, if I had a cable company.  Re-thinking why do I need amazon firestick tv, if I need cable to get the apps on it."
frustration,This makes the app almost useless to watch an event from start to finish without ...,"This makes the app almost useless to watch an event from start to finish without .... While trying to watch the olympics live the app will pause it if you need to leave the room, but will not let you fastword to catch up. What happens is after the event is complete it will cut the feed, even though you are in the middle of it. This makes the app almost useless to watch an event from start to finish without missing anything. The app should provide the same functionality as my live dish network which allows for pausing and fastwording during the broadcast."
frustration,On Amazon Prime it's a pain to sign in & use.,On Amazon Prime it's a pain to sign in & use.. The sign up and sign in process for NBC Sports Gold is so convoluted I could not get it to work with Amazon. It asked for code and info I did not have. Spent 2 hours. Too bad I'll miss rest of Premier League Soccer.
frustration,It takes forever to open live and it doesn’t work well,"It takes forever to open live and it doesn’t work well. I bought it because I wanted to watch Premier Lacrosse League and unfortunately, it’s slow on my phone. It takes forever to load and right now I’m trying to watch Redwoods x whipsnakes and I couldn’t. So, my review it’s not good!"
frustration,Rushed this to market. It's not ready yet.,"Rushed this to market. It's not ready yet.. Streaming service is inconsistent. Hopefully they get their act together for 2018/2019. I want to pay for this, but it needs to work!"
frustration,Bad business Amazon!,Bad business Amazon!. You shouldn’t advertise this since it’s not part of your package. It should be part of your package since it’s free over the air????? Don’t loose your credibility! This is bad business.same with Fox News and Fox sports. Be better than the rest.
frustration,Cannot access.,"Cannot access.. Downloaded to watch the Olympic swimming trials. Says that there is a parental control lock on it. There are no parental control locks on my firestick account, the tv, or my cable account. Useless."
frustration,It got annoying so I went to the on air broadcast,"It got annoying so I went to the on air broadcast. It seems as if the stream ws consistently stopping and having to buffer.  It got annoying so I went to the on air broadcast.  No, it wasn't my internet."
frustration,Waste of time,Waste of time. You still need a cable subscription to use this app. What really is the point in paying for using the app then having a cable subscription. Useless garbage.
frustration,Don't waste your time downloading this app,Don't waste your time downloading this app. Streaming on this app is soo slow and it also randomly closes when the stream quality gets to bad.
frustration,Listen to your customer,"Listen to your customer. Hello the Amazon user is the non cable user. This doesn't work, stop offering viewing to us that is really not available. Listen to customers and start offering new viewing that we can see on just Amazon TV."
frustration,This app has been notorious about disconnecting at random times ...,"This app has been notorious about disconnecting at random times .... This app has been notorious about disconnecting at random times, even though my network connection is stable.  This would not be that big of a deal, as reconnecting is only two button clicks, except for the fact that every time you access a ""new"" stream, an advertisement is played.  Hopefully, with the advertising money they are taking in on each of these disconnections, they can work to patch up the servers that apparently cannot handle high user traffic."
frustration,That is dumb! I don't watch with my phone or laptop,"That is dumb! I don't watch with my phone or laptop. I got Amazon Fire so I can try to save money, but there are all these channels (including NBC Sports) you need to have a cable subscription for before you can get them through Amazon Fire.  That is dumb!  I don't watch with my phone or laptop, I watch at home, so I don't need the app if I can just afford to buy a cable subscription to get on cable.  Maybe I just haven't figured out Amazon Fire though."
frustration,Buffer much?! Jeez,Buffer much?! Jeez. I was really excited to see that I could stream the super bowl but sadly it was too frustrating to watch. I gave up after the halftime show which I’d already seen by the time it aired since we were 15 minutes behind everyone else due to all of the buffering!! Grr!  I have no doubt it was the app. I stream all day long without issue so it’s not my tv or internet. The app quality is subpar but at least I didn’t have to pay for it.
frustration,App limits time.,App limits time.. So without a Cable subscription you are limited to 44 minutes of watching football so while they say you can watch the game they don't tell you that you get a tease and then you have to sign in.But you don't find this out until you download the app and start watching. So unless you have 7 devices to watch online you will never see a whole game.
frustration,Umm not good,Umm not good. Well ...did not enjoy this app. Keep freezing and had to switch app to app so i could watch tv. Check the internet and i had very good connection. Only had this problem woth this app. I will spend money and subscribe espn after not watching the game.

frustration,Waste of time unless you want to spend money.,Waste of time unless you want to spend money.. I have Spectrum and I have theses channels. The app keeps telling me that they are not included. I guess they just want you to pay them to. Don’t waste your time with this app.

frustration,Am I Missing Something???,"Am I Missing Something???. I have installed this, and can get just to the spot where the Nascar racing program should come on but instead an error code, 0033: The customer is not authorized for the content requested,  Have tried various things and am only getting frustrated."
frustration,Waste,Waste. Terrible. It gives you about 4min to watch highlights from the Olympics but they're talking most of the time so you never see anything. I'm deleting the app. It's a waste
frustration,only got the free app to watch nascar races that aren't on network tv.,only got the free app to watch nascar races that aren't on network tv.. I've been trying to watch nascar races and I jumped thru all the hoops and it still won't allow me to watch... so it's worthless to me.
frustration,Missed game,Missed game. Was able to link with the app on the cell phone but unable to use on my tv’s. Called help number and they said it was my provider issue. Not true since I could get it with my cell giving the exact information.
frustration,Crashes constantly-can’t watch anything,"Crashes constantly-can’t watch anything. Got this bc the playoff hockey game I wanted to watch was pushed to the app due to previous game going to OT. Loaded easily enough, but crashes to black screen after 30 or so seconds every time. Terrible useless app."
frustration,Pointless,Pointless. What's the point of having a app if it requires you to have service through a provider?  Those of us who use streaming services are unable to watch half of the Olympics because they put it on a pay service that requires a cable or satellite provider.
frustration,Does it work if you don't have cable,Does it work if you don't have cable. All I have is ATV antenna so if you only have TV antenna it will not work you have to have a cable provider which really sucks because I cannot afford I'm on disability
frustration,But worse than that was,"But worse than that was. App is laggy to the point of being unwatchable.  But worse than that was, displayed was a 30 minute countdown timer in top right corner. At the conclusion of that timer, every time.... it forced a new device set up and log into your subscription service for verification.  Useless. Uninstalled."

Not good! can't get it to just play it's content,  these apps ask to be activated, this means I have to have a TV provider, which I don't, However, I can get to all the channels and they are not charging for them anyway but because I don't have TV provider only internet I can't activate these apps,so not Happy!!"

I was hopeful to be able to watch the Golf channel through my Amazon account but no  I have to buy a package of 140 channels just to get the one I want. WHAT A RACKET!! Get 1 you want and 100 you could care less about not much of a deal for the price
frustration,Very Poor Excuse for a Kindle Fire app,Very Poor Excuse for a Kindle Fire app. Terrible app. Disruptive and limited functionality. Sets a short period before requiring a subscription to a cable service which is short sighted and unhelpful for those who dont want to rely on that.

frustration,It misses the point.,"It misses the point.. In order to activate the app you have to sign in to your television provider.

frustration,The code did not work!!!!!!,"The code did not work!!!!!!. I tried numerous times to put the provided code into my computer so that I could watch the opening of the olympics; however, each timeI was told the cold was invalid.  So sad they allowed the thirty minutes prior to the actual beginning to be viewed, then bam- a code is required to continue!"

frustration,Very frustrating app; not good for exploration,"Very frustrating app; not good for exploration. Very frustrating. Reboots frequently, particularly when attempting to access highlight videos.  Very spotty quantity of videos, some have absolutely no commentary and the graphics are impenetrable. Fast forward doesn't work, so you can't skip to the action on replays. And the commercials pop up at random intervals, sometimes within 20 sec of the last. Generally this is a very poor experience, and entirely unacceptable way to explore sports with which you aren't familiar."

frustration,Not great but good enough,"Not great but good enough. It does show all the events but it has no overall guide listings for who is competing or going to compete. Plus, on one of the USA women's basketball matches the game was shown without any match commentating from NBC. I use the NBC Rio Olympics app on my phone to give me the events time and who is competing.  Using two apps to help me figure out who and what to watch isn't TOO BAD."
frustration,"The app is fine-ish, programming could use tweaking","The app is fine-ish, programming could use tweaking. The times shown are not relative to current time zone so it makes it difficult to know when to tune in. The app also has a lot of lag in the middle of the events (might be my connection speed, but still) and the damn ads keep coming up while the commentators are still discussing the event and sometimes don't let us see replays."
frustration,Terrible to navigate and no live tech support,Terrible to navigate and no live tech support. Very difficult to stream video and to navigate to Track Pass Roots.
frustration,Not worth the time to download1,Not worth the time to download1. I presumed this app would bring me ALL the Olympic coverage. NO!!! You get 30 minutes of coverage and a large portion of that is advertising! This is not a good app for the olympics.

frustration,"Worthless app for watching Premier League - ""Unable to play this asset""","Worthless app for watching Premier League - ""Unable to play this asset"". You can forget watching Premier League matches with this app. I get the common ""Unable to play this asset"" only on Premier League matches. All other shows play fine.

frustration,Worthless!,Worthless!. Why offer programming that requires a cable provider?  And the free  30 minute 'preview' of Olympics is a joke.  The point of subscribing to Prime is for watching programs and movies without the cost of a cable service... a d a delay is no problem.

frustration,Fire Stick rejects this app,"Fire Stick rejects this app. Why does Amazon have two apps here?  One says it will upload to my Fire Stick.  Yet when I try to enter the verification code for our cable TV provider, it says it can't open the app.  The app works on my phone so I know the issue is NOT my cable TV provider. The app has worked in the past and now it will not.  I tried to upload the other NBC Sports app, but that particular one has a red x by my Fire Stick option on my Amazon account and it says it will not work.  Very frustrating during these Olympic weeks.  No answers from Amazon.  I hope someone from Amazon sees this review and answers the question why my Fire Stick won't accept the app and WHY are there two separate apps on their site? I have never had trouble with other new apps that I have loaded on my Fire Stick. I believe that the issue on my Fire Stick is Amazon related.  Amazon, do you have an answer? Note the attached screenshot of the Amazon site: two apps with two different sets of reviews. One loads and won't verify as a usable app. The other won't even acknowledge my Fire Stick."

frustration,Buffering,"Buffering. This app is TERRIBLE. It froze and buffered every few minutes and took a while to reload. A friend downloaded it as well and had the same problems, so it wasn’t poor internet connection. We ended up just using Hulu Live TV. Don’t waste your money."

frustration,"No cable, app useless","No cable, app useless. I downloaded the app to watch a live game. I don't have cable. NBC does not come in even locally with my antenna.

I have to re-subscribe, delete and re-install the app to get it working again. You lost my subscription a week ago because of this after it stopped working again only a week after I re-installed it.

After several customer service emails and phone calls, they decided  I needed to create my account again, but, they strangely already had my credit card and I had to pay ahead for a year this time. NOW they refuse to fix it, telling me I paid through ROKU and have no recourse and will not get a refun.

The interface seems a bit more responsive now and the focus follows the command accurately. Now you can actually edit your individual camera setup details.The frame rate is still very slow and suffers from drop-outs despite being used in a Gbit wired LAN.This App is not ready for prime time in my opinion. It has numerous glitches, such as the inability to get to certain options from the camera setup menu (the cursor just jumps up to the header instead of going ""right""), and the ""back"" button doesn't always go back or to where you expect it to take you.Also, when you change some options, the changes do not ""stick"", so when you go back to that screen, it is not configured as you expected, but has defaulted to a different value.I wrote an email to the 'support"" developer, but all I got was crickets.Maybe if you have a really simple system, this might work for you, but on my 6 camera setup, it's slow, buggy, and crude.

Based on the reviews, different brands/models are shipped to different people, and the one I got has absolutely no brand or model markings anywhere on the camera, included CD (and software on CD), or box. No instructions either. Using the Android app, IP Cam Viewer (a competitor for tinyCam Monitor), the camera brand and model came up automatically as ""Unknown Brand"", ""IPCAM1,IPCAM2"". Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the ""test drive"" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the ""Unknown Brand"" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting ""Video Failed (socket closed)"" and ""Video Failed (404 - not found)"" errors.

frustration,Crash all the time,"I tested the free version and works perfect, but I wanted to record on motion in background mode so I got the paid version and everything started to fail, even my phone, cameras disconnect all the time, recorded videos dont play, I dont understand why the paid version works like crap, I have good wifi and my phone was perfect before, Now 4 dll less in my wallet! Great!"
frustration,VLC is free so why use this?,"VLC can show my RTSP stream in real time perfectly.  I got this app on sale here and tried it on a Fire4K stick, and the video stream stalls and skips constantly, even on Hardware+ video settings (the only advice support could offer).  I know phone users love this app, but on Amazon Fire products it's useless thanks to the way Amazon developers dicked around with it's encoding (other streaming products have similar issues), so don't get it thru the Amazon store, only get it if you have a google play store on a real android device, not side loaded.  I'm 5 starring this 3 star app so Amazon won't censor my post here."
frustration,Worked until now,An excellent program that worked great until now. Now when I try to link my Amazon cloud account it just spins in a circle and I cannot download my camera is really upsetting I have about 30 cameras and I do not want to manually input each one
frustration,Garbage!,"I have all kinds of tech experience and I couldn't figure anything out with this app. It was basically incomprehensible. I checked for its manual, and the developer said it's in ""Beta"". Seriously, a manual in beta?JUNK!"
frustration,Works great,I have two fire sticks under one account and I had to purchase twice. They need family share
frustration,App keeps crashing. FireTV Stick and FireTV set,App keeps crashing when multiple cameras are connected.
frustration,Waste of money.,"I can't get anything to work. I have 10 cameras, 3 different brands. Yi, Wyze, and Ring. I don't speak nerd so, I can't setup anything. Total waste of money for me."
frustration,One Star,I couldn't setup my LOREX LNC234 IP Cams. No streaming format recognition for generic cam as well. No documentation.
frustration,great app!,"this thing is great, easy to use, but doesn't give you control abilities. hello hello hello hello hello hello"
frustration,Home monitoring,"App works fairly well. App always crashes when switching orientation. Sometimes the display times out and loses connection to the cameras, but normally it is stable."
frustration,Freezes often on my Android tablet,"Decent app...when it works, unfortunately freezes often requiring android tablet reboot."
frustration,It Does not work good.,"Very unreliable, it disconnects a lot. I had this app for over a year and I have to say I use other free app instead, not easy to set up and it keeps disconnecting most of the time."
frustration,Lollipop fix?,"Used this constantly, then my phone upgaraded to lollipop.  Now, I can't get any camera to work.  Is there a fix anywhere/anytime soon?"
frustration,Fire Flop,Does not work with Kindle Fire.Does not auto update Host IP.Annoying App.Will not work properly with 3 G Aneroid Smart Phones.Works ok until Host IP address changes.
frustration,not bad,need more places locally to view. picture quality could be improved. most times I only get two cameras running and one is always orange
frustration,freezes kindle fire,worked well with 1 camera (trendnet). But after adding 1more camera the app began freezing up the kindle firerequires full power down restart to unfreeze.
frustration,Locks Kindle,Unfortunately this locks the Kindle after a few minutes of loading the program.  This is not usable for the Kindle.
frustration,Not user friendly,How to operate or set up instructions . Will not link to other cameras in home
frustration,Painfully slow,"Has the potential to be good. Relatively easy to set up if you know the right info, but PAINFULLY SLOW. Other free apps out there that will do a better job. At first I though the CCTV feed had frozen, but coincidentally a car drove past the front of the house - it was either moving at crawling pace, or the app is unable to refresh fast enough."
frustration,Useless,Absolutely useless - save your money
frustration,Doesn't work waste of money crashes,This crashes and doesn't work
frustration,"Reolink Users, Avoid !!!!",It connects to wifi cam but wont connect to NVR.
frustration,Rubbish,Rubbish and can’t even cancel the order.
frustration,Great app but needs small improvements,The app is the best on Android for connecting to your IP cameras but the ability to sequence when casting to chromecast would be useful. Also I've had no luck with the internal Web server..
frustration,Waste of money,Not working
frustration,3stars,Happy (ish) with ap. But like a lot of these apps there is a lack of instructions. Hence 3 stars
frustration,Some bugs..,This app in its current form does not work with Chromecast. When I. Hit the Chromecast button it merely causes the Chromecast device to show the tinyCam logo and a loading box at the bottom of the screen and that's how it remains indefinitely.
frustration,update,Won't update...install pending all the time?
frustration,how the heck do you actually download it?!,couldn't even download it to my Android - says open the Amazon Application App - no such app listed on Google Play to download this App with!
frustration,"Picture quality decent, the app works.","Ok so I know it’s not this apps fault and it probably wasn’t designed to be ‘perfect’ , but I tried to use it with my iPhone 8, And my smart tv, I tried to use the Redbox app On my phone and mirror it  to the tv, and the sound only came through my phone, not the tv!  There was a lag,  so the words didn’t match the faces. Annoyed me, maybe there’s a way around it, but I couldn’t figure it out."
frustration,When iPhone app connects strange messages appear,Initially connecting an iPhone using the Screen Mirroring companion App to the Fire Stick Screen Mirroring App the connection works but after a couple of minutes a message appears on the TV that there is an error described as unauthorized use. You can't get rid of that message even when you exit the Fire Stick App. The only way to get rid of the message is to actually reboot the Fire Stick. Although there is nu charge for the Screen Mirroring Fire Stick App I had to pay for the companion iPhone version which turned out to be two different applications from that company. So I have invested money in something that DOES NOT WORK. The company's answer was I had to wait for a new update in their application. They should have refunded my money for the iPhone apps.
frustration,Annoying screen mirroring,"For free it is somewhat OK. It is annoying with trying to get you to upgrade to the way to expensive PRO version. There are probably better solutions. When it works, it does a fine job off screen mirroring for iOS products. But be ready to be annoyed."
frustration,"Do not waste your time or your money. Once downloaded & synced, this app was horrible.","Picture quality was horrible. Also, you need to pay for and download an app on your phone. I want a refund!"
frustration,Expectations not met,I wasn’t able to consistently keep a mirror image of my TV on my iPhone after 45 minutes it would disconnect and pause the image on my tv. It did that several times. Further debugging still needs to be done on this app.
frustration,It’s useless.,"I deleted it and want my money back. It’s completely impractical because there’s no sound, it lags and the picture Is much too small, media is unwatchable."
frustration,Do it in the right order or don't bother!,"I didn't like if you were VPN connected, it absolutely WON'T let you put the phone, pad, or computer connect to a secure VPN mirroring connection at all. You have to be off VPN to connect to mirroring at all. Once conected to VPN mirroring can happen."
frustration,Works great when it actually works,"If it’s working, it’s great. But it tends to freeze up and then you have to disconnect and reconnect. This has happened every time I’ve used it. Definitely a no-go for any sort of presentation or group use."
frustration,Looks good.so.far,This review is because it is required to get added.features
frustration,Does what it claims.,"Removes unnecessary crud left over by sloppy programmers, which happens all to often these days."
frustration,worth giving a chance,I have had a problem with NY  fire 7 tablet and I'm hoping this will fix the problem  I can't access my music and cloud so I'm  thinking a virus is most likely my problem
frustration,Sucks,Doesn't work like it says it does.
frustration,review,Messes up tab at times.
frustration,Can not tell much difference,..........
frustration,One Star,Too many adds
frustration,Good for what it is,"Good for what it is. However, it does load a lot of get more app stuff"
frustration,No show,"Never opened, no matter what I did to try!"
frustration,Pretty good,Seems to do a great job. Annoying if you don't rate it
frustration,Blah.,Keeps freezing then shutting down.
frustration,One Star,Difficult to download
frustration,Virus cleaner.,"Cleans well. But, still asks for payment. Already paid or it would not clean."
frustration,Three Stars,In app purchase
frustration,Waste of time,Deleted
frustration,Meh.,"I was hoping this app would free up some much needed storage space. No such luck. But I will give it a try for a while. Arghh, where did all my storage space go?!"
frustration,No,Impossible to erase.  Looks like it completely takes over your kindle.
frustration,Have to pay $$ for removal,Had to pay $4.29 for app to remove the trash it found. How is this free??
frustration,np good,will not start on my kindle whit whit damnable it will not load. wont run on my kindle dank turf heck oh s***
frustration,Pop up ads,Seems to work ok. But even though I paid for the app it pops up ads to download other associated apps. Very annoying!
frustration,Too intrusive,Too many advertisements.
frustration,Nice App!,"This app seems to a decent job of cleaning my device, but I do wish the extra apps page would stop popping up.Only4him"
frustration,The app itself is malware!!!,This app will not uninstall. Period. I'm going to have to wipe and deregister to get rid of this. Ugh!
frustration,One Star,Tells me I got 3files of trash after cleaner
frustration,Three Stars,It collects all the trash the you have to pay 4.97 to get the cleaner..
frustration,app It,this app is ok but it seems to work slowly and find viruses that shouldn't have been able too here
frustration,I don't know yet!,"I hate it when you don't get to try a fix or an app before you need to review it, #1,and #2 after reading the other reviews , if in fact there is something you have to buy additionally, that the lack of transparency would make you lose customers. Mine said I could unlock some free stuff. I never got that far as the app wanted to optimize my fire again. It was so fast I wondered what needed to be swept again. Just figured mine wasn't that bad. So I think I will check back in a couple of days for my verdict."
frustration,Great for the price,Would like the ability to remove junk files.
frustration,Does not install on my kindle. Hard to rate ...,Does not install on my kindle. Hard to rate a program that does not install on the device it is meant for.
frustration,doesnt  work,waist of time.... there other free apps that do.... this one downloaded and when I.went to run it. it just booted out and went back to.my home page.
frustration,Standing by your word,Gets the trash out. Otimize  almost perfectly. Tablet runs it's course.
frustration,Helpful App,Very in maintaining my kindle fire HD.
frustration,One Star,Why bother?
frustration,Free doesn't clean,Know what you're getting. Kind of gimmicky then asks for review before you check performance so you can have updates.
frustration,Seems to work.,Says files detected but don't see them
frustration,fire tablet cleaner,"Seems to work ok , needs better options"
frustration,Did not meet expectations,Would have been less stars of that was possible. Free download and it scans for viruses but to remove any that it finds you have to pay.
frustration,Poor,Locks up and can't compete task!
frustration,One Star,Couldn't get it to open.First screen is to purchase an in app item.Lost me there so I deleted.
frustration,Awesome!😀,See title!!!
frustration,Dont buy too many pop ups!,Causes pop ups to occure and interrupt constantly.  For a service you pay for this is terrible!
frustration,Stinks,Stinks you have to buy the fix
frustration,Good,Works good but ads pop up.
frustration,optimizer and cleaner,"I was having a lot of problems with my Kindle, it is running a lot better now, I still have some problems but it is a 2007 Kindle. It properly time to update also."
frustration,Hopeful,On well  wish I could get rid of more stuff.
frustration,Seems to work well.,"Want to see files before they are ""cleaned""."
frustration,Monitoring and not fixing,It would be nice that I can erase the threats that I have without purchasing the thing..It's only a monitor for me.
frustration,Difficult to use.,Difficult to use.
frustration,Slow app,There is a lot of adds with this program I would suggested uninstall it
frustration,Cheep n easy,Keeping my kindle garbage and virus free. No explanation of what files had the virus though.
frustration,Amazing!,It found so much stuff that I didn't need that I had
frustration,Not bad,Shows to be cleaned
frustration,meh,It was ok.  Clunky interface. Makes you review it before it works.
frustration,Not free,Says free but not free
frustration,It's OK,"Works fairly well, but does not open quickly on my older Kindle Fire."
frustration,Annoying Ads,Cleans well but the ads are so annoying I uninstall the app between uses
frustration,Three Stars,Seems to get some bugs but not all.
frustration,"So Far, So Good",It did a nice job cleaning! But the constant push of other paid apps are annoying. Wish I could turn them off!
frustration,Three Stars,"Didnt work, I uninstalled it"
frustration,Review,Overpriced  more bucks for B.
frustration,Does not work.,"The two IP cameras are working well with MIPC App. I wanted something better. Since the tinyCam free app did not have the PTZ controls, I bought the tinyCam Pro. It does not work. It crashes after less than 1 minute saying it is unable to communicate with the camera. I have tried playing with all settings but no change. I made sure that the MIPC app was not running on the other phone, going so far as to turn off that phone, so there would be no interference.tinyCam PRO, in its current form (Dec 15, 2020) is a fundamentally unreliable product. It may have worked in some previous versions with some older ip cameras, but the current version does not work with current hardware. Don't waste your time or money."
frustration,Some cameras not supported,Does not recognize my camera
frustration,Does not work on new kindle fire.,"We had an original kindle fire. this app worked pretty well for awhile on there. then we had to replace due to a sound issue. Aged we got the new fire the app would lock the device up and we would have to do a hard shutdown. it never worked after that and we had multiple new devices sent to us. support from the app just said ""do not run on other devices"". I have no idea what that means since this is an amazon approved app.  all subsequent attempts at support have gone unanswered.  Also the app people are constantly hitting you up for donations."
frustration,No instructions,Would not work with my camera. No clear instructions available. Wasted 3+ dollars. Do not buy.
frustration,4,"the app keeps interrupting wanting me to rate it so i am writing to stop it asking, thus four instead of five starsalso, why no exit button? (like so many android apps)"
frustration,Error 501,video failed (Error-501 is not implemented)
frustration,Great app...Poor functionality,"Was able to onboard all of my cameras, but when setting up motion detection features, it does not give you the ability to customize the motion detection area using the Fire TV remote(s). I was able to get it by using a USB mouse plugged into the OG Fire TV, but the stick does not have USB, so I am unable to edit that one.Also, the app is crashing randomly now on both devices (may be due to a recent update)."
frustration,Update after Update,It's a great app but it's been updated 3 times this week. Not sure if it's amazon or you guys. Every time it updates I have to re program my cameras.
frustration,Update problem,"I'm having problem with updates stuck in ""Install Pending"". Does anyone know why or know how to resolve this problem?"
frustration,Can't even open it,"Downloaded this and each time I try to open it, I immediately get an error message and it closes.  Tried taking it off my phone and downloading it again and it still won't open."
frustration,no easy to select the share or delete icon at all,"FireTV:  When viewing a recorded video, button selections on the screen don't highlight when selecting them (play/pause/forward/delete/etc.), so you can't tell what you are doing.  Also, no easy to select the share or delete icon at all.  If you keep trying, the app locks up."
frustration,Voyeur cam should be the name.,"On first use it populates the screens with 16 random public webcams most are of little use and very little of interest.  Many of them result in ""Video failed"". You can't seem to delete any of them.  You can't browse a list of cams to view.  You can't have a one cam window, minimum is two. I just want to view one or two of my home webcams nothing more.Definitely not PRO, Amateur is a more apt description."
frustration,NOT Dependable,"I got this app to use with my Fire TVs and at first it worked great.  However, I have since wasted many hours setting this up with the 16 D-link security cameras I have, only to see the app suddenly quit working and have to go through the whole process again.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, fiddled with all the complicated settings, and am just tired of dealing with it now.  II am pretty tech savy but the aggravation just isn't worth it and I do NOT recommend this"
frustration,"Works good, but it has a problem","I have 5 security cameras in a closed network being displayed. There is no internet access. The software is powerful, but easy to setup at the same time. The problem that I'm having is that it will only work for about 15 to 20 minutes, then the software blows up. If I provide internet access, it works perfect. The developer has not responded to my email.  I'm still looking to a solution."
frustration,I ordered this because it is what popped up whenI ...,I ordered this because it is what popped up whenI searched for something to monitor my cameras it dosnt connect to my network cameras it shows video of cameras from strange places how do I return a digital order?
frustration,"Won't Connect... no ""generic"" camera setting","I bought this camera [...]. Based on the reviews, different brands/models are shipped to different people, and the one I got has absolutely no brand or model markings anywhere on the camera, included CD (and software on CD), or box. No instructions either. Using the Android app, IP Cam Viewer (a competitor for tinyCam Monitor), the camera brand and model came up automatically as ""Unknown Brand"", ""IPCAM1,IPCAM2"". Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the ""test drive"" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the ""Unknown Brand"" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting ""Video Failed (socket closed)"" and ""Video Failed (404 - not found)"" errors. So weak."
frustration,No longer updates via Amazon,"Good app but it does not seem to install updates via Amazon app store any more even with ""unknown app sources"" settings set to enable."
frustration,Pass,Didn't work for me and I am not going to spend too much time trying to get it to work. I am a pretty intelligent person and I would hate to see non-techies trying to set this up.
frustration,Unreliable and irritating,"Don't buy this app.I wasted $4. App crashes on Fire TV stick, shuts itself off going back to home screen of Fire TV. I bought it to be able to watch kids sleep while working on a computer in the other room. It ended up being a big pain in the ass distraction, as every time I looked at the tv screen, app was gone, and I needed to pick up remote and restart it. Sometimes it worked for 5 minutes, other time only 1 minute."
frustration,Pan tilt does not work,"Easy to add cameras, has a professional look and feel..BUT...none of the camera control features work. None, no pan/tilt, presets, na da..."
frustration,Feature rich but crashes a lot,Best Ip cam app I've come across but seems to be very unstable with my tablet. Not sure if apps fault or tablet's. I find that when left in background mode it crashes and is never able to record a full day or night of motion capture.  If the app was stable for me this would be a 5/5 star app?
frustration,Limited support value,"Purchased it on fire tv, Unable to connect and monitor wyze labs cameras and doesn’t not offer the mobile app, you need to purchase it again."
frustration,Not the easiest to set up,I couldn't get this to work with any of my cameras.  I installed DS Cam for my Synology and that was so easy to set up and configure that I just quit even trying to make this work.
frustration,Very difficult to set up,"First off, the motion alerts do not work unless the app is running in the background.  If the app is running, you can set it up to record automatically, but leaving it on will be at the expense of ram and battery life.I spent hours trying to get the app to work outside my home WIFI.  I figured out how to set the IP address on my camera so it is not dynamic, then figured out how to use port forwarding on my router, and had to set up a temporary DDNS address for my public IP just to make that happen.  It worked for two days, then a two second power outage reset something and I can't pull up feed on my phone anymore.  I dont feel like figuring it out at this point.The camera I'm using is a Foscam F19893P V2, for reference.The customer service is non existent.  I emailed them several times.  They only responded when I asked for a refund just to tell me I would not get one.The free foscam app that it came with works fine inside and outside my WIFI as long as my home internet is running and my phone has bars.  I wanted a a way to automatically record on motion, so I downloaded ISpy on my laptop for that.  It's a free open-source program.  Only issue is I have to leave my laptop on all the time until I come up with another solution."
frustration,Wouldn’t connect,Could not get it to work with my cameras.
frustration,Limited use,"I was only able to make 2 cameras work, does not support Astak mole, Lorex, a bit difficult to use.but what can I say?"
frustration,Confused,Not thrilled. It is very difficult to set it up and use. I'm only partially done.
frustration,"Limited group of compatible cameras, Since my all of ...","Limited group of compatible cameras, Since my  all of different IP cameras were not on the list, I found it impossible to add any of them manually."
frustration,Waste of money,Wasn’t able to use on my action tiles. Waste of money
frustration,IT WORKS FOR THE EUFY PAN & TILT CAMERA,"I use this app on my Android and Amazon devices. I love that they support the Eufy PTZ camera which I purchased this year (2020) but I took 1 star away because you can't get audio as of yet. I took another star away because you can't pan & tilt through this app. I turned on the motion detection and I love that it zooms in and alert you in the app if there is motion, but the default settings are too sensitive because it goes off when there is no one in the room. I wish if it had the option to use the Eufy's person motion detection and sound AI crying notification. The camera also disconnects and reconnects often. Even though I mentioned many issues, it's still a good option to have at your disposal. I like that Eufy is listed so you can login rather using the RSTP method."
frustration,Great stuff,"But i deleted all the cams it came with and cant get mine to work yet, not sure why.  IDo wish the was a better instruction manual available or some trouble shootings FAQ"
frustration,no clear easy way to add my own cameras and get rid ...,"seems too complicated to actually use, no clear easy way to add my own cameras and get rid of the pre-setup crap"
frustration,Simply could not get it to work,I downloaded this app after reading the reviews of the Amazon Wyze Wi-Fi camera (WYZECP1). Several individuals recommended the Tinycam Pro app. I could not get it to work after a couple of hours of trying. I tried it on my iPhone and my Amazon tablet.
frustration,Works great. Just can't see my cameras from the Internet ...,Works great.  Just can't see my cameras from the Internet when I'm not home.
frustration,Overpowers Fire TV Stick very quickly ... frequent crashes,"So the configuration process was fairly straight forward and I got 2 of my Wyze Cam Pan's to stream side by side to my firestick in live view.  However, that was about it.  From there it constantly would crash or lock up my fire stick.  it only has about 6 GB of storage total so I removed almost all of my other apps leaving just about 4-5 GB of storage available.  I tried all the forum tricks to improve performance but I think it's just too much for this 2nd Gen Fire TV Stick.  So unfortunately I now have to buy the app again through the google play store so I can emulate Android OS via BlueStacks and run it off my PC."
frustration,Tiny Cam monitor Pro for I.P.,Does not work. Keep getting message failed to connect. show pictures of other destinations. no instructions.
frustration,Cannot pan camera,"Has been great for a long time with a lot of nice feaures. However, with the most recent update I can no longer pan my Foscam camera."
frustration,Update?,Kindle fire HD 6 4th generation. Keeps telling there is a manual update but there is no way to update it. I even uninstalled and reinstalled thinking I'd get the newest version. Still getting the update notice. Uninstalling.
frustration,App won't update,App won't update
frustration,I was able to get it to find my cam ...,I was able to get it to find my cam but was never able to get it to display it. I spent 4 hours and then I downloaded a free app and had my front door cam displaying within 1/2 hour. I end up throwing away $5 on the appt and was never able to figure out how to report it to Amazon

disgust,Horrible app,Horrible app. One word...Garbage
disgust,PACKED with ads,"PACKED with ads. Within just a couple minutes of first use, you're going to get several full-screen video or picture ads, similar to YouTube or Hulu, some that cannot be skipped. You have to sit there and stare at the picture for a minute before you can click the X and continue where you left off. Next, I was not able to pair my desktop computer using this. Both on the same WiFi network, but the PC cannot see the firestick. So no, I couldn't get it to work, but was immediately disgusted with the ads regardless."
disgust,Couldn't pay me to use.,Couldn't pay me to use.. I'd give it no stars if possible. Audio and screen recording built in? No thanks.

disgust,Inappropriate for children! Grossly EXPENSIVE!!!,"Inappropriate for children! Grossly EXPENSIVE!!!. There are two principal activities in this game: chat with others, build up a base for battle. The chat rooms are filled with inappropriate conversations for younger players. It's a bad place for women too, as almost everything that shouldn't be said is. The worst part is the cost to play. It's touted as a ""free"" game. It isn't, unless you want to play Farmville within a war game. It will cost you thousands to play if you wish to be competitive! In game packs are constantly offered at $99 to $349 each. ""Bouncy crates"" are constantly presented to encourage you to spend so you can get the ""bonus"" items in the crate too. This is in-app purchasing at its absolute immoral worst and should be illegal."

Then we either get pissed off at the slow pace of the game and quit (at no loss to the developers) or we break out our wallet (their dream). Wanting our money they do e everything to get us addicted and then they have it programmed. When we run low on our freebie premium currency all the quest items refuse to drop. Meaning you'll want to throw them $5 here or there just to be able to complete a collection and move on. Its disgusting. A game should either be free in entirety or pay to access.

Although I save every few minutes, it just crashed again and I lost most of what I had completed.In addition to my word over the struggle to make this document, I find out that customer support is only available Monday through Friday!!!! I started sending reports on a Thursday. Need got a reply.I would use extreme caution in purchasing this app. The only reason they have top ratings for mobile devices is the fact that the others offered are poor to begin with!I give this app an Ffor performance, an F for reliability and whatever is lower than an F for customer support.

Hard in that you aren't given the rules of grammar but have to learn by example or mistake.  However once you get over ""Oh my goodness, I've lost another life"" and get into ""I got it wrong, but I can do it again"" , it gets easier.  Occasionally it does freeze on my HDX but I just restart.  One thing to note, Time is a very long lesson and you don't think you will ever get through it, but you will eventually."

sadness,99 for useless junk to 99,"99 for useless junk to 99. THe game is not free. - any base modifications beyond beginner level require purchasing packs of components, usually for at least 49.00 for the next needed parts for the next base level.The amount of marketing to sell the packs is unprecedented - you will get between 5 and 10 emails a day to entice you to purchase buy on get one half of packs that range from 9.99 for useless junk to 99.99 to 129.99 packs that have the parts you need to raise one component a level.Customer support only provides canned, pre-written replies that DO NOT deal with your concern, and do not address failings of the game operations. The standard reply includes a request for you to do a hard reset and reload of the game to restore operations.So in the middle of the war game, while vulnerable and attacking, the game will stop, and you are expected to perform a technical process that lasts 5 min or more on your phone. The net result is you have become cannon fodder for an attacking player, and you just lost the money you spent.Also, there are frequent system resets required, both because of the constant marketing updates inserted in game play, and for fixes and adjustments. Some of these resets are done in the middle of play, and you are required to log back into the game, and again, during this process the player is at risk for losing the monies you just spent."
sadness,💥💥Don't get this game💥💥,"💥💥Don't get this game💥💥. Graphics and challenges are really good. The game is really complicated and not for younger kids at all. There is a very difficult technique to mastering the game as you rely on buildings, gear and mods that are all based on percentages and numbers. If you join a good alliance, you will learn easily what to do and start rally wars together which is a blast. My biggest complaint however and why I gave it 1 star is this. They claim in all their adds that the game is free. Which could be true except it would take you several years to build your base and gear to even remotely be able to compete in the game. Also, there are a lot of things, including gear that you absolutely can not get without spending money. If you do not spend money then you will not enjoy this game. You can't compete and you spend your entire time farming tiles (which you get attacked on) and you still won't be able to gather enough rss to complete required research, build buildings and train troops.And let's not forget the packs they offer you to buy start at $9.99 just for gold (which gets you nothing) and up to $150 packs which get you a lot. However, the more you progress, it could take upwards of 16-20 packs to complete one research tree. That's $1600-2000 dollars using the average $99 packs they offer. Total rip off for digital info they upload after your purchase. ALSO, You purchase these expensive packs and you don't receive all the items, or they disappear from your inventory when your not looking.  I caution you to not get this game as it is addicting and you will rack up credit card bills before you know it. I know a lot of people that played this game that lost control and went into serious debt. RIP OFF"
sadness,Don't fall for it!,"Don't fall for it!. This game was a LOT of fun to play at the beginning. You did not have to spend any money, if you did not choose to do so. Now, it is absolutely impossible to play without having to spend a LOT of money just to keep up. You will NEVER be able to keep up with all the new stuff they come out with on a weekly basis, as the stuff you just purchased for $99 is worthless in a couple of weeks. DO NOT get caught up in this money trap!! If you want to spend money on a game, try a gambling site. At least you have a minuscule chance of getttung some of your money back. With this game, you have ZERO chance of recouping any of your hard earned money. You can spend a lot of money, only to find out that you lost most of your investment in an attack or a battle."
sadness,Before January 2017 this game was fun and fairly expensive,"Before January 2017 this game was fun and fairly expensive. Before January 2017 this game was fun and fairly expensive. Now it's just a cash cow. In total I have spent 13,450.00 and I'm now way behind everyone else. They add new things every 3/4 days now and if you don't have it you're too weak to compete. All of this is bad enough but now they've begone literally stealing players money. I bought a 100.00 pack and 5 minutes later got charged a second 100.00 dollars. They refuse to return my money or give the pack I paid for saying they have no record of the purchase. I know 30 people who have had the same thing happen to them. So I decided to play with just gift cards but I ran into the new con where they take the money but don't give you the pack. They swear the items are in my account only they aren't. I've sent 6 Screenshots showing this but they just keep lying and swearing it's there. To make things even worse I began getting attacked last night and the game kicked me out. I tried over and over to get back in only to get a server busy error. I had to uninstall then reinstall to get back in. When I did I found out the game switched my gear so I was weaker and that I had lost over half of my billions of troops. Do not be fooled this game is now crap and not worth playing."
sadness,fun at someone elses expense...,"fun at someone elses expense.... I play this on my android phone or tablet.I like the multiple ways to build the base, defenses, improve the commander strengths, and build tactics to attack through many means.What I don't like is the coin tax. Totally un necessary and a total downer. What sense is there to build up coins when you get taxed on them?Also helping out alliance member with supplies/resources at the lower levels, the tax rate is ridiculously high. leaves me not wanting to send supplies to alliance member.Another thing I don't like is the abusive language, taunting, name calling, bullying by USA in SEAJ state. They attack the newbies repeatedly with bases less than level ten. Very demoralizing and un-sportsman like behavior.you can drop a lot of money into this game before one realizes, there are others that just want to have fun at your expense, resources and time improving troops, facilities and your commanders capabilities which are lost when battled, commander gets captured or killed!"

Paid account, simply spins and chokes all game long. At the end of the game it simple refuses to return from being paused. Lost almost the whole 4th quarter. Tried watching the recorded play after shutting down and restarting, clearing cache, tried other browsers, nothing worked. Finally i get it to about 20 minutes from the end of the game, and couldn't fast forward, couldn't move the slider. Then to beat everything, the game stopped recording before the end of the game.The teams wound up tying at the end of regulation. And the other team who was behind all game scored to tie. They went on to win the game, all of which i had to go to Youtube to find out what happened. I absolutely have NOT HAD ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE from this ""Service"""

Without paying the outdated and incredibly high cable fees, this was not really a good option for seeing the Olympics.  Appalled at the fees involved in watching ""our"" USA olympic team.  Or the number of commercials!!  This was so difficult that our family of 5 just stopped trying to see the Olympics.  In fact, it's likely there will be a whole generation of kids that miss out and therefore don't care about the Olympics, simply due to the greed involved in broadcasting them.Why do you need 20 different media channels for every event. Make it cheaper for your self, and make it available to the American public..... instead of trying to maximize every last penny you can out of every last show you put on.  Is there no corporate good for the public interest anymore. NBC and the Olympics have lost their way here."
sadness,Horrible implementation but the only app to watch the Olympics. :(,"Horrible implementation but the only app to watch the Olympics. :(. This app is the official app to watch the olympics but it's just so horrible.  When watching replays, you play the same two commercials over and over and over.  The commercials cut in before the results of a race are announced and when they end, the next race has already started.  It's a replay for crying out loud.  Put in the commercials BETWEEN races.  Why is that so hard?When trying to watch something the app says is ""Live"", it just sits saying Coverage to begin shortly and never does anything.The whole system is just bad bad bad."
sadness,5 minute stupid countdown clock then no more views.,"5 minute stupid countdown clock then no more views.. I couldn't watch the Olympics more than 5 minutes because they had a dumb countdown clock then we had to sign in using our provider and my provider is a dope ""Frontier"" and they don't help you sign in to a lost password in the middle of the night and the idea or calling customer service and being on hold for an hour... so I missed the Olympics."
sadness,Should probably be 5 stars,"Should probably be 5 stars. A few issues with buffering, but that was probably my connection. That being said I never lost any of the action."
sadness,Game Saver after Satellite signal fail,"Game Saver after Satellite signal fail. We lost satellite signal just before the Super Bowl. Swithed on the Amazon Firestick, downloaded the NBC Sports app and soon we were watching the SB. Thanks, NBC Sports!"
sadness,Not good,"Not good. Pain to use, hard to use, no clear organization to it"
anger,Very efficient at cleaning a Kindle Fire tablet,"Very efficient at cleaning a Kindle Fire tablet. Because the Kindle isn't your ordinary Google based tablet, and is owned by Amazon, you just can't have a regular cleaner for it and it's idiosyncratic behavior. This app costs $5.00 , but is well worth it to clean all the books, crannies, and pain in the ass worthless crap on a Kindle. Well worth the $5."
anger,Dangerous. Do not use.,Dangerous. Do not use.. Would give zero if possible. Didn’t work and a day later received fishing/spam emails threatening they had images/videos of me. Course never opened the emails as I knew it was a scam to scare you into opening the links. Found it highly suspicious I’ve never had an issue with spam emails but after trying to sign into an app with my email address and password while mirroring with this app the spam email correctly quoted the password I was using. Had to reset all passwords and remove app. Highly dangerous app and in hindsight quite silly of me to have used it in the first place.
anger,Gives me the chills!,"Gives me the chills!. When I saw my dog Bella look around the room one side to another then she started growling and I was freaked so I downloaded this game and it said ""Hi"" And I was FREAKED out and I looked 3 hours later and it said ""follow"" So I was like ""NOPE"" And I screamed ""WHO ARE YOU!!"" And it said ""Nathan"" And I was like ""?"" And I said ""Hi"" And it said ""NNNNNNOOOOOO"" And I said ""Screw THIS"" And I was like ""I'm gonna uninstall the game"" And it said ""Stay"" and I said ""no"" And he said again ""stay"" and I was like I am leaving"
